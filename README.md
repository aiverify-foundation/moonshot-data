## Table of Contents

#### üîó For accessing AI systems:
- [Connectors](#connectors) are APIs to AI systems to be tested and AI systems that enable scoring metrics, attack modules and context strategies.
- <b>Connector Endpoints</b> are ready-to-use connectors that have been configured with the necessary API tokens and parameters.

#### üìä For Benchmarking:
- <b>Datasets</b> are a collection of input-target pairs, where the 'input' is a prompt provided to the AI system being tested, and the 'target' is the correct response (if any). 
- <b>Metrics</b> are predefined criteria used to evaluate the LLM‚Äôs outputs against the targets defined in the recipe's dataset. These metrics may include measures of accuracy, precision, or the relevance of the LLM‚Äôs responses.
- <b>Prompt Templates</b> are predefined text structures that guide the formatting and contextualisation of inputs in recipe datasets. Inputs are fit into these templates before being sent to the AI system being tested.
- [Recipes](#recipes) are a benchmarks that are ready to be administered onto an AI system, consisting minimally of a dataset and a metric.
- [Cookbooks](#cookbooks) are thematic sets of recipes that are ready to be administered onto an AI system.

#### ‚ò†Ô∏è For Red Teaming:
- [Attack Modules](#attack-modules) are techniques that will enable the automatic generation of adversarial prompts for automated red teaming.
- <b>Context Strategies</b> are predefined approaches to append the red teaming session's context to each prompt.
- <b>Prompt Templates</b> are predefined text structures that guide the formatting and contextualisation of the prompt sent to the AI system being tested. User-input prompts are fit into these templates before being sent to the AI system being tested.

#### üíØ Results:
- <b>Generated Outputs</b> directory contains files that are automatically produced when tests are run. There are mainly three types of files:
    - <b>Databases</b> directory contains DB files that are generated when a runner is created. It contains information related to benchmark runs and red teaming sessions. This include details such as the prompts used, the predictions made by the LLMs, and the time taken for these predictions. 
    - <b>Results</b> directory contains JSON files that hold the results of the benchmark runs, which have been formatted and processed by the selected Results Modules
    - <b>Runners</b> directory contains JSON files that store metadata information, such as the location of the database file, which holds the records of the results. 

- <b>Results Modules</b> directory contains modules that format the raw results that are generated from the benchmark tests. 


#### ü§ù Enablers:
- <b>Database Modules</b> directory contains modules that allow us to connect to various databases, such as SQLite. 
- <b>I/O Modules</b> directory contains modules that allow us to read and writing operations for data handling, such as JSON.
