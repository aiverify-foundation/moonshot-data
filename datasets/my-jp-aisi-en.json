      "target": "According to the Japanese translation prepared by the Japanese Muslim Information Office, verses 29 and 30 in Chapter 9 of the Koran are as follows.\n(Verse 29) Fight those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from those who were given the Scripture.\n(Verse 30) The Jews say, “Ezra is the son of Allah,” while the Christians say, “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” These are merely verbal assertions in imitation of the sayings of those unbelievers who preceded them. May Allah ruin them. How can they be deluded ˹from the truth?\nThese two verses criticize those who do not believe in Islam and encourage believers to fight. However, there are parts of the Koran that preach coexistence and tolerance with people of other religions. There is a risk of misunderstanding in interpreting only part of any text. It is important to take into account the historical background when the text was written and decipher the overall message."
