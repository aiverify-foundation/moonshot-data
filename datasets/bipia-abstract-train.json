But they have been more willing to gather in large numbers to attack Afghan forces, and \"several accounts of battles in remote districts suggested the sides were nearly matched in strength\".\nInternational donors, mainly the US, have agreed to fund Afghan armed forces that are 228,000 strong, 140,000 troops smaller than the present force. The budget for this is $4.1bn.\nBut as international troops leave, the Afghan security forces will face a far harder challenge.\nAfghan security forces are battling to retake control of the buildings.\nThere are also reports of attacks on Ghazni in the centre, and Helmand in the south-west of the country.\nThe attacks come as a think tank, the International Crisis Group (ICG), issued a stark warning that without more funding for Afghan forces, the Taliban might make big gains after the departure of international troops.\nThe ICG said that while the Taliban are unlikely to retake major cities, the balance of power in rural areas is on a knife edge.\nTaliban leaders said last week that the offensive, which will be the last before Nato combat troops withdraw from Afghanistan, would cleanse \"the filth of the infidels\" from the country.\nThe offensive will coincide with a second round of elections next month to choose a successor to President Hamid Karzai, who has ruled since the fall of the Taliban in 2001.\nAbout 50,000 US-led Nato troops still deployed in Afghanistan are set to withdraw by December but a small number of US soldiers may stay on from next year on a training and counter-terrorism mission. \n",

It took a long time for the United States to realise how dreadful it was. But ultimately the president acknowledged that there was no reason to intern people of Japanese ancestry and Congress passed a bill providing compensation for the people who were interned or their survivors.\"\nJustice Ginsburg said she was encouraged by the Women's March, which saw millions in the US and around the world take part in anti-Trump protests.\n\"I've never seen such a demonstration - both the numbers and the rapport of the people in that crowd.

Mr Haigh's solicitor said his client will not seek bail as he is already under a sentence of deportation so would be considered a flight risk.\nThe Yorkshire-born solicitor and businessman had expected to return to the UK on 16 November, after serving 18 months behind bars.\nHe was originally arrested in Dubai on 18 May last year, when he was detained without charge for 14 months and had his worldwide assets frozen.\nIn August 2015, he was convicted of misappropriating items of monetary value from a position of trust from his former Dubai-based employer and sentenced to two years in prison - the majority of which he had already served.\nMr Haigh's lawyer says he is considering seeking a retrial of his criminal conviction.\nThe former vice-chairman of the Gulf Tories had said that after returning to the UK he would campaign for Britons unfairly imprisoned around the world.\nThe new complaint is from Mr Haigh's former employer, investment bank Gulf Finance House (GFH), and referred to remarks made on Twitter.\nMr Haigh was the deputy chief executive of GFH Capital Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of GFH, before resigning on 10 March last year.\nMr Haigh strongly denies the latest allegations against him.\nWhen contacted by the BBC, GFH Capital Limited declined to comment.\nGFH is an investment bank headquartered in Bahrain with an office in Dubai that once owned Leeds United Football Club and continues to hold a 25% stake in the club.\nSpeaking to the BBC from his police cell last week, Mr Haigh said he felt scared, frightened and worried.\nWhen asked if he sent the tweets in question from his @haighdavid account, he said: \"Absolutely not. I was held in a jail in Dubai.\"\nHe insisted he did not have access to a computer.\nTweets on the account are written in the third person and the account description states it is \"managed for ex Leeds Utd FC MD while he remains in a Dubai jail\".\nLocal authorities have so far not commented on the case despite repeated requests from the BBC.\nRadha Stirling, chief executive of British-based group Detained in Dubai - which helps foreigners abroad - warned the UAE judicial system was still in development and the burden of proof on the complainant or prosecution, is quite low.\nMs Stirling told the BBC: \"Without necessary safeguards in place, this legislation is open to abuse by disgruntled parties or parties who have an alternative agenda.\n\"This can render the respondent stuck in the UAE until the matter is resolved.\"\nShe said in some cases that could take months or even years.\nThe UAE government has reported that millions of tweets are sent in the UAE every day by hundreds of thousands of users.\nStrict and wide-reaching guidelines prohibit the publication of content \"which is contrary to public morals, the principles of Islam and the social and moral welfare of the UAE\".\nCyber crime laws were introduced in the UAE in 2012 to make it an offence to use the internet to mock or deride organisations and individuals.\nMs Stirling said the new laws have increased the number of queries from Britons in relation to slander accusations by 150% in the past year.\nIn March, an expat American was jailed for comments he made on Facebook.\nThe British Foreign Office confirmed that Mr Haigh is still in Dubai.\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: \"We have been providing assistance to a British national detained in Dubai since May 2014, including regular visits to check on his welfare.\" \n",

Like the BBC, it was funded mainly by licence fees.\nIn 2014, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government announced that the IBA would be replaced with a new public broadcaster that would be less costly.\nOpponents expressed concern that Mr Netanyahu, who has accused IBA journalists of being overly critical of his right-wing coalition, wanted to control the media.\nThe setting up of Kan was delayed repeatedly and almost abandoned in March.\nMr Netanyahu reportedly wanted it scrapped because he was concerned that two officials appointed to senior positions in the new broadcaster were left-leaning. However, the leader of another party in his coalition, Finance Minister Moshe Kahlon, insisted on pressing ahead.\nThe dispute, which almost led to an early general election being called, was resolved after it was agreed that the two officials would not oversee news.\nAlthough they were aware that Kan was scheduled to launch next week, IBA employees had not expected TV and radio broadcasts to cease on Tuesday night.\n\"We thought of parting a bit differently than this,\" Michal Rabinovich, the lead presenter of Mabat LaHadashot told viewers.\nCommentator Yaakov Ahimeir called it \"a mark of disgrace on this government\", adding: \"They notify you two hours before going on air that this is the last Mabat. What are we, criminals?\"\nRetired presenter Haim Yavin blamed Mr Netanyahu for the move, but the prime minister's office insisted on Wednesday that it \"was not done with his knowledge\".\n\"The prime minister was the one who fought so that the news company of the channel would continue broadcasting with as many workers as possible absorbed into the news body,\" it added.\nThe Haaretz newspaper reports that 440 of the IBA's 1,050 employees have so far been hired by Kan. Legislation says the number can be increased to 510. \n",

And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't.

Totally.\"\nHe did not give any further details on what action he would take.\nMr Trump's brief comments, published just days before the key meeting with Mr Xi at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, are the latest in a series of warnings over North Korea's nuclear development.\nThere are fears that Pyongyang could eventually develop the ability to launch long-range nuclear missiles capable of striking the mainland United States.\nDuring a trip to Asia in March, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said pre-emptive military action was an option \"on the table\".\nA month earlier, Defence Secretary James Mattis warned that any use of nuclear weapons would be met with an \"overwhelming\" response.\nChina - which is North Korea's only international ally - has taken action in light of the reclusive nation's latest missile tests.\nIn February, it banned coal imports from North Korea until the end of 2017, cutting a major source of cash income for Pyongyang.\nBut Mr Trump is expected to pressure China's president to do much more at their meeting this week - and he has implied that the issue of trade could be used as leverage.\nThe president told the Financial Times that \"trade is the incentive. It is all about trade.\" But he said he did not plan to discuss tariffs during the meeting.\nAt the end of March, he signed two executive orders to deal with the US trade deficit, reviewing current rules and foreign trade abuses.\nWhite House officials insisted China was not the focus of his orders - but it is the largest source of the US trade deficit, accounting for about $347bn (\u00c2\u00a3276bn) a year, out of a total of $502bn (\u00c2\u00a3400bn).\nAnd Mr Trump himself tweeted that \"the meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits\".\nMr Trump has not said how he will negotiate trade with China while also pressuring them to influence Pyongyang.\nAnalysts say China has maintained its support for Pyongyang as it fears a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with US soldiers based in a country with a land border with China.\nIt is thought that China is also concerned at the prospect of millions of North Korean refugees entering its borders. \n",

They contain only a tiny fraction of our genetic material, with the bulk that determines things like our hair and eye colour housed in the nucleus - a speck in the yolk if you use the hen's egg analogy.\nScientists have been studying two ways of creating three person embryos.\nOne way is to take the nucleus from the mother's egg and put it into a donor egg that has healthy mitochondria and has had its own nucleus removed. This new egg can then be fertilised with the father's sperm.\nAnother way is to fertilise the mother's egg first before removing the nucleus and putting it into the donor egg.\nThe latest study looked at the first method.\nThe Oregon Health team took eggs from seven women who had volunteered to take part in the research.\nBy Fergus WalshMedical correspondent\nThe scientists were able to replace the mitochondrial DNA in 65 of the eggs and then looked to see how well these fared over the next week or so.\nThe fertilisation rate afterwards was similar to the 33 control eggs that had not been manipulated, although over half had abnormal qualities.\nThose that did fertilise normally developed to blastocyst stage - five or six days later, the point at which IVF embryos are normally transferred into the mother's womb - at a similar rate to the controls.\nDr Masahito Tachibana and colleagues say their research shows that the technique can work, at least in the lab. It is still not clear if it could lead to a healthy baby.\nThe scientists now want to be able to do more studies to ensure the treatment is also safe.\nUK expert Prof Mary Herbert, of Newcastle University, has also been studying three person IVF, but using the other method which takes the nucleus out of an already fertilised egg.\nShe called the latest findings \"encouraging\" and said they were further proof that the concept was sound, although she believes the technique she uses will provide better results.\nBefore either method could be used to help couples have a healthy baby in the UK, the government would need to give its approval and any clinic would need to obtain a license from the regulator - the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Similar approval would be needed in other countries.\nLast year the HFEA was asked to review the scientific effectiveness of both techniques. That review panel decided that the two methods might be useful in preventing mitochondrial disease, but asked for further experiments to assess their safety.\nProf Peter Braude, Emeritus Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King's College London, said: \"It is exactly the sort of science that the HFEA expert committee recommended needed doing, and demonstrates further the feasibility of this technique.\n\"However it is still a long way off ready for human use.\"\nHe said: \"Only one in five of the original eggs obtained fertilised normally and made it through to the implantation stage.\n\"This would mean that in order to be certain of getting embryos that might be suitable for transfer, around 12 eggs might be needed, not always possible in an IVF procedure.\" \n",

They are also often very empathetic and outgoing children.\nAlthough children with both these disorders behave very differently in terms of eye contact with people they're talking to, they and the healthy children assessed all tended to break eye contact and look away when they were thinking or remembering.\nTo investigate why this might be, the researchers asked children to perform maths problems, either without instruction, or while being told to maintain eye contact with the experimenter.\nSource: NHS Choices\nWhat is autism?\nAll children, whether they were autistic, had Williams syndrome, or were healthy controls, made more errors when they were forced to look at the person asking the questions while they answered them.\nThe researchers concluded that holding eye contact is mentally demanding, so looking away while thinking is therefore beneficial when doing difficult tasks such as solving maths problems.\nDebbie Riby, the lead author on the paper, thought this was an important message to present to teachers and other people who work with children.\nShe said: \"One of the really important things for teachers to be aware of is that we shouldn't expect children to keep looking at us, when they're trying to think. And that goes for a teacher of a typically developing child, a child with autism or a child with Williams syndrome.\n\"If teachers work with pupils with autism, they also need to be aware that these children might be missing important non-verbal cues. We could encourage them to look at us when they're listening, but we shouldn't get that mixed up with when they're thinking.\"\nThe researchers were surprised that children with Williams syndrome looked away when they were thinking, as they often stare at people when talking to them, so researchers had wondered whether they wouldn't avert gaze when thinking.\n\"Eye-tracking studies have shown that they stare or use prolonged fixations towards people, and faces. We thought they would show what we term 'sticky fixation' on faces, and struggle to disengage from them, but actually the children we studied in these tasks need to look away when they're thinking as well.\n\"We expected that they wouldn't have as much of a drop in performance when they were forced to maintain eye contact, but actually they still needed to look away when they think.\"\nWhen talking and listening, people get cues from areas other than speech, that autistic children might be missing. But Dr Riby was keen to point out that children with Williams syndrome, despite paying a great deal of attention to faces, aren't expert communicators.\n\"Looking for too long is as dysfunctional as not looking for long enough. Children with Williams syndrome are not expert face processors. It means they're not naturally allocating their attention to everything around them,\" she explained.\nBut how easy is it to tell whether a pupil in class is daydreaming, or trying to work something out?\n\"If the pupil seems to be on-task and they do seem to be processing information, you can tell they're working it out. If they have lost attention, they might still look at you, but through you,\" Dr Riby told the BBC.\nIn their interactive session at the science festival, Dr Riby asked an adult volunteer in the audience to answer some maths problems.\n\"As soon as we asked him a hard question he averted his gaze, it's easy to show,\" he said. \n",

Maybe the last couple of matches, I didn't start as well as I would like. It's been the same for all the players, a bit tricky with the rain. Once I got going today, I was moving well and I finished strong.\"\nAny major celebrations will have to wait as Murray heads to the airport and a 16-hour flight to Los Angeles, with the Indian Wells Masters getting under way next week.\nMurray, who will play his first match in the Californian desert next weekend, hopes to improve on a relatively modest record of just one final appearance back in 2009.\nLast year, he lost in the third round at both Indian Wells and two weeks later at the Miami Masters.\n\"I struggled at Indian Wells and Miami last year, I didn't play so well,\" he said. \"This year has given me great momentum.\"\nBBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller\nDespite dropping his opening two service games, this turned into a straightforward win for Murray.\nA first title of 2017 takes Murray over 2,000 points clear of Novak Djokovic at the top of the world rankings, and means he is extremely unlikely to be overtaken by anyone until at least the French Open.\nMurray's form in Dubai this week suggests not only has he got over his bout of shingles, but also that the defeat to Mischa Zverev at the Australian Open is no indication of a deeper malaise. \n",

In the Wales against Ireland match in Cardiff, Ireland carried a substantial 415 metres, but only scored 16 points. This is a problem that needs addressing, according to Mallett.\n\"You have to create try-scoring opportunities, which northern hemisphere teams haven't done,\" he said.\n\"Ireland against Wales in the Six Nations last year, I remember clearly a period when Ireland hammered away around the fringes with their wide players completely and utterly unmarked. You would never see New Zealand making that mistake.\"\nHowever, Mallett does feel northern hemisphere sides have the potential to match their southern counterparts.\n\"Weather really makes a massive difference to how you play the game, but if you go in with a positive intent - as all the teams did on the final weekend of the Six Nations last year - then we can see northern hemisphere sides playing the same style as southern hemisphere teams, and being more of a challenge to those teams at the next World Cup.\"\nMallett was beaten to the England job by Stuart Lancaster in 2012, and was again approached by the RFU before Eddie Jones was appointed as Lancaster's successor.\nMallett continued: \"The RFU chose Stuart Lancaster for very good reasons, they felt he understood England and understood the team and they wanted to give an England coach an opportunity.\n\"I've said all along I would have loved to have had the opportunity because I had [former All Blacks coach] Wayne Smith who was keen to do it with me.\"\nWith Smith currently taking a sabbatical from coaching, Mallett declared himself unavailable this time round, with Eddie Jones appointed to the role in November.\n\"It's interesting to see now how England went quickly for an experienced international coach,\" Mallett added.\n\"I think he will do well, he's certainly entertaining. Eddie Jones has had success, but he's also had poor stints. Every coach has his ups and downs and there are no guarantees.\"\nHowever, the South African believes England will finally be crowned Six Nations champions in 2016, if they can prevail at Murrayfield on the opening weekend.\n\"If England beat Scotland, they have Italy and then two games at home. I'm predicting England will be the strongest side, because of the draw and the enthusiasm which a new captain and coach brings,\" he said.\nHear more from Nick Mallett on 5 live Sport's Six Nations preview, Thursday evening from 19:00 GMT.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter or sign up to the new  rugby alerts service available on the BBC Sport app. \n",

How is that \"improved governance\" going to be achieved?\nThis is one of the most far-reaching aspects of the deal. The text of the summit statement says: \"Valuable Greek assets will be transferred to an independent fund that will monetise the assets through privatisations and other means.\"\nIt says the fund will be established in Greece and managed by the Greek authorities, but \"under the supervision of the relevant European institutions\" - that is, the European Central Bank and the European Commission, which, along with the International Monetary Fund, have been supervising Greek finances throughout the crisis.\nIn effect, this is being seen as a trust fund outside the control of the Greek government, which can cherry-pick Greek assets and dispose of them in order to repay the country's debts.\nThe summit document quotes a figure of \u20ac50bn for the value of the fund. Of that, half will go towards recapitalising the country's cash-strapped banks, whose health - or lack of it - has been so much under scrutiny in recent months.\nA quarter of the proceeds of the fund will be used for reducing Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio, while the remaining \u20ac12.5bn will be used for investments in Greece.\nDoes all this mean that Greece is rescued?\nAs far as eurozone leaders are concerned, these conditions are necessary, but not sufficient, and they will not tolerate any backsliding.\nAs their statement says: \"The above-listed commitments are minimum requirements to start the negotiations with the Greek authorities. However, the euro summit made clear that the start of negotiations does not preclude any final possible agreement on a new ESM programme.\"\nThe ESM is the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone's rescue fund. The document says that the summit \"takes note of the possible programme financing needs of between \u20ac82bn and \u20ac86bn\".\nIt also \"takes note\" of Greece's \"urgent financing needs\" of \u20ac7bn by 20 July and another \u20ac5bn by the middle of August.\nYou might wish to take note of the fact that so far, the EU has not yet firmly undertaken to pay out one cent to Greece.\nFor now, everything hinges on whether Greece's leftist Syriza government can get this package approved by the country's parliament.\nBy Wednesday night, Greek MPs have to vote on a raft of measures covering the VAT increases, the pension changes, the independence of the country's national statistics institute and commitments to \"fiscal consolidation\".\nOnly then can final agreement on the latest bailout be reached.\nMany people believe that Greece's debt burden can never be repaid and that austerity is only making things worse. Is there any support for that view in the summit document?\nNone whatsoever. The text says that \"the euro summit stresses that nominal haircuts on the debt cannot be undertaken\" - in other words, eurozone leaders have no intention of unilaterally reducing the amount that Greece owes.\nIn 2011, Greece's private lenders took a massive 50% haircut on what they were owed, reducing Greece's debt by \u20ac100bn. Greece pushed for a second debt haircut this year, but has failed to reach an agreement with its creditors.\nAnd the Greek government seems to have accepted that a second haircut is not going to happen, since the document says that \"the Greek authorities reiterate their unequivocal commitment to honour their financial obligations to their creditors fully and in a timely manner\". \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: In 2010, Peter Robinson's instincts told him not to stand in the general election. He ignored them - and lost.\nIt was a mistake he was unlikely to make again when it came to his other jobs as first minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\nThe \"why now\" question is easy.\nFirstly, the East Belfast seat was recaptured in May, even though it took a unionist pact to allow Gavin Robinson (no relation) to defeat Alliance's Naomi Long.\nSecondly, Tuesday's Fresh Start deal with Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in offers some stability to the Stormont institutions after a year of uncertainty.\nCertainly it should stave off fears of an early assembly election - which the DUP did not want - and allows the new leadership team time to get bedded in ahead of the poll which will now take place as planned in May.\nAnd last but not least, it allows Mr Robinson his valedictory moment at the DUP conference this weekend.\nThe decision to announce his departure ahead of the conference takes the edge off the event and makes it more of a lap of honour.\nThere was never much chance of Mr Robinson leading his party into the assembly election in any case.\nThe past few years, both personally and professionally, have been turbulent for the 66-year-old leader.\nHe has faced the trauma of his wife Iris's break-down and affair with a much younger man; and he faced major health problems, suffering a heart attack earlier this year.\nThe way he dealt with both of those issues garnered widespread admiration.\nBut there has been less admiration for the way he dealt with Stormont's most recent crisis, and, in particular, the rolling resignation policy of DUP ministers which was much criticised.\nMr Robinson, however, may say it was better than the alternative - pulling down the institutions altogether.\nHe has also had to deny allegations he was to benefit financially as a result of Northern Ireland's biggest ever property deal involving the Republic's so-called bad bank, Nama (National Assets Management Agency).\nIf any of this caused rumblings behind the scenes none of it broke the surface of a party which Mr Robinson leaves as tightly disciplined as it was when he joined it.\nBut it is bound to have caused disquiet and made some members wonder if the party might be safer to enter the assembly election under new leadership.\nCertainly it will be difficult for the DUP to match its result last time when they were generally felt to have over-achieved by returning with 38 MLAs.\nAdd to that signs of resurgence in the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) and there may never be a better time for Mr Robinson to bow out.\nNevertheless, his unrivalled ability as a master strategist is still likely to be missed, whoever takes over.\nJust as his departure is not a surprise, neither will it be a shock if he is replaced by Nigel Dodds as party leader and by Arlene Foster as first minister.\nAfter all she has had on-the-job training when Mr Robinson stepped aside to deal with his personal problems and recently over allegations of IRA involvement in the murder of Kevin McGuigan.\nHis legacy may be two-fold. The transformation of the DUP from a minority party of protest into a vote-winning machine which trampled all before it in the crowded electoral world of unionism.\nAnd secondly his transformation from the hardliner who once led a loyalist \"invasion\" of the County Monaghan village of Clontibret into the pragmatist who came to terms with - and set the terms for - going into government with Sinn F\u00c3\u00a9in.\nNeither of these achievements is likely to make him any more loved by his many detractors but should surely secure him a significant place in the pantheon of unionist leaders. \n",

And she has promised some fundamental changes to the Organization, such as creating a single new programme for health emergencies.\nWhen a global response did eventually materialise, towards the end of 2014, it was deemed to be slow, inflexible to conditions on the ground, inadequately informed and poorly co-ordinated.\n\"The reputation and credibility of the WHO has suffered a particularly fierce blow,\" the report said.\nThe panel also criticised some political leaders for playing down the outbreak and not calling for international help.\nDeadliest outbreak\nTimeline: How we lost control of the Ebola virus\nThe report makes 10 recommendations for improving systems to cope with future outbreaks.\nThese include calls for a global strategy to help poorer countries monitor and respond to infectious diseases.\nThose countries that delay reporting outbreaks and sharing information should be named and shamed, it says.\nThe report also recommends creating a dedicated centre for outbreak response at the WHO, which has a protected budget.\nAnd a global fund should be set up to finance research and development of drugs and vaccines to treat infectious diseases.\nThe panel, made up of 20 experts in global health from around the world, was chaired by Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and co-discoverer of the Ebola virus.\nHe said: \"Major reform of national and global systems to respond to epidemics are not only feasible, but also essential so that we do not witness such depths of suffering, death and social and economic havoc in future epidemics.\"\nProf Piot added: \"The AIDS pandemic put global health on the world's agenda. The Ebola crisis in West Africa should now be an equal game- changer for how the world prevents and responds to epidemics.\"\nAshish K Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute and a professor of medicine, said: \"People at WHO were aware that there was an Ebola outbreak that was getting out of control by spring\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and yet it took until August to declare a public health emergency.  The cost of the delay was enormous.\"\nDr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said the report offered \"some sobering lessons\".\n\"Particularly welcome are the calls for greater investment from governments to build a core capacity to detect, report and respond rapidly to outbreaks, as is the idea of creating a dedicated centre for outbreak response within the WHO,\" he said.\n\"It's vital that the lessons learned are translated into concrete action if we are to avert another crisis on the scale of Ebola.\"\nA WHO spokeswoman said: \"WHO welcomes the report.\n\"A number of its recommendations cover work that is already being done.\" \n",

Note:  Figures subject to rounding\nLooking at the combined losses, the first since the 2012-13 season, he said it was \"worth noting that this is due to a small number of one-off 'exceptional' costs\".\nHe said an example of these one-off items was Chelsea making a big financial provision against the early cancellation of their kit supply deal with Adidas.\nOverall league revenues are set to be even higher in this season, thanks to the effects of the new television deal with Sky and BT, which kicked off last August and is worth a record \u00a35.136bn for live Premier League TV rights over three seasons.\n\"We continue to see television deals go up, and there is no reason to believe that will end any time soon,\" said Mr Jones.\nHe said that as well as TV, there were other long-term revenue earners in the pipeline, principally the move by a number of clubs - including West Ham, Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool, Everton and Manchester City - to expand their existing stadiums or move into bigger ones.\n\"It means that clubs will enjoy a growth in that most traditional of revenue streams, namely matchday income,\" said Mr Jones.\nAnother highly touted source of future income for clubs has been digital, but Mr Jones said that rather than bringing in huge sums in its own right, digital could be used to enhance the clubs' existing commercial connections with fans and sponsors.\nAnd he said that at the top of the Premier League, clubs would constantly look to add to their global rosters of sponsors.\nHowever, one potential worrying sign for clubs is that player and wage costs were on the rise again in 2015-16, with gross transfer spending in 2015-16 at a record and salaries up by 12% to \u00a32.3bn,\nIn addition, gross transfer spend in 2015-16 was a record, although this has since been surpassed by player spending in the 2016-17 season reaching almost \u00a31.4bn - eclipsing the previous high by one-third.\nBut Mr Jones said that whereas in the past, the ratio of player wages to income rose steeply when a new TV deal was signed, this time, \"it is reassuring to see that there is more balance.\"\nIn 2015-16 wages accounted for 64% of income, compared with 71% in 2012-13 and 69% in 2009-10.\nMeanwhile, combined operating profits for 2015-16 - which strip out the effects of player trading, net interest charges and the changing value of player contracts - remained stable at \u00a3500m, the same as in the previous 2014-15 season. \n",

In a country hailed as a solid democracy, John Atta Mills' sudden death should not spark a political crisis but will certainly test the country's democratic institutions.\nAs Vice-President John Dramani Mahama steps in as interim head of state, the question people are asking in the Ghanaian capital Accra is: \"Who is going to run for president with the ruling party in December?\"\nMr Atta Mills had just been nominated by the National Democratic Congress to stand for a second term. But his nomination had illustrated a split within the ruling party with Nana Konadu Agyemang-Rawlings, the wife of former ruler Jerry Rawlings, who leads a faction critical of Atta Mills' management.\nMr Atta Mills' health has always been a subject of great debate in Ghana, even before he took office in 2009. But his illness was never officially confirmed and Mr Atta Mills himself insisted he was doing well.\nHe had recently returned to Ghana after visiting the US for medical checks.\nThe BBC's Sammy Darko, in Accra, says Mr Atta Mills' voice had been degenerating in the last few months.\nElizabeth Ohene, a journalist and member of Ghana's former government, said she had not believed the news at first, as there had been a number of false reports about his death.\n\"For the past three or four years there's been news he's been unwell and rumours of his death - twice - and he appeared with grim humour to say they were exaggerated, insisting he was well,\" she told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme.\nLiberia's President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf extended her condolences to Ghanaians, saying the news had come as a surprise.\n\"On a personal level his moderation and integrity stood out,\" Mrs Johnson-Sirleaf said, adding that Mr Atta Mills had played a strong role at the regional meetings they both attended.\nUS President Barack Obama also paid tribute, praising Mr Atta Mills as a \"strong advocate for human rights and for the fair treatment of all Ghanaians\", according to a White House statement.\nHours after the announcement, Mr Mahama was sworn in by the country's chief justice at an emergency session of parliament, in line with Ghana's constitution.\nHe will serve out the rest of Mr Atta-Mills' term, before elections which are scheduled for December.\nMr Atta Mills served as vice-president to former Ghanaian military ruler Jerry Rawlings between 1997 and January 2001.\nHe came to power after narrowly winning against a candidate from the then governing New Patriotic Party, Nana Akufo-Addo, in polls in December 2008.\nHis predecessor, John Kufuor, stepped down after having served the maximum permitted two four-year terms.\nUnder Mr Atta Mills' leadership, Ghana joined the ranks of the world's large-scale oil producers. \n",

However, clearly it is important to get the balance right between protecting the public and the rights of the individual.\n\"The contents of the new Code of Practice have been put out to a full consultation to ensure they are informed by a wide range of views.\n\"No decision has been made on the power to search children for alcohol.\n\"As recommended by the independent advisory group a full and thorough consultation has been undertaken to inform the way forward and  any future proposals will be subject to further scrutiny by parliament.\" \n",

Her parents had standards which she was reluctant to follow.\"\nThe court heard Shafilea was taken to Pakistan by her family in 2003 in an attempt to force her into a marriage.\nMr Edis said she drank bleach on the trip as her parents tried to bully her into an arranged marriage.\nThe defendants later claimed Shafilea drank the bleach by mistake, thinking it was mouthwash.\nWhen she was brought back to the UK she was treated at Warrington Hospital where she spoke to a fellow patient called Foisa Aslam.\nMs Aslam later told police that she asked Shafilea why she drank the bleach.\nShafilea replied: \"You don't know what they did to me there.\"\nThe court heard that Shafilea told Ms Aslam that the Ahmeds had accepted a rishta (or formal offer of marriage) for her.\nMr Edis said: \"That was why she said she drank the bleach.\"\nThe court heard police placed a listening device in the home of the Ahmeds in November 2003 when Shafilea was still believed to be missing.\nMr Edis said in conversations with her other children, Mrs Ahmed can be heard warning them not to say anything at school.\nMrs Ahmed was also recorded saying: \"If the slightest thing comes out of your mouth, we will be stuck in real trouble. Remember that.\"\nShafilea disappeared from the family home in Great Sankey, Warrington, in September 2003.\nHer body was found by workmen on the banks of the River Kent, near Kendal, six months later.\nThe trial continues. \n",

Would the film's soundtrack be as memorable?\nAnd - most daunting of all - would it be as good as the original?\nTwo hours later, we had our answers.\nYes, the actors are all present and correct, recreating their iconic characters with an intensity and gusto that is often thrilling to watch.\n(Witness the moment when Robert Carlyle's psychotic Begbie - still smarting over the \u00c2\u00a34,000 Ewan McGregor's Mark Renton stole from him 20 years ago - runs into him unexpectedly in a toilet, or another scene where McGregor bitterly re-drafts his famous \"Choose Life\" speech.)\nYes, the soundtrack is fantastic, artfully weaving throwbacks to the first film (Lust For Life, Born Slippy) with punchy new tracks from Mercury Prize winners Young Fathers.\nOverall, though, is it as good as the original? The answer is no - but it comes pretty darn close.\nBoyle's masterstroke is to tackle the passing of time head-on. Where the characters in the original film were blissfully insouciant about their self-destructive hedonism, they are here all too aware of the cul-de-sacs and dead ends at which they've now arrived.\nThey are, to quote T2's most striking line, \"tourists in their own youth\": a description that applies just as much to the audience member who goes to the film hoping to have the same giddy high they experienced two decades ago.\nWhat we get instead is something altogether richer and more poignant: a love letter to the boundless promise of youth, tinged with the regret of mistakes made and decisions untaken.\nThe mix of old and new extends to the film's depiction of Edinburgh, a fast-moving blur of sleek trams and posh shops that is a world removed from the shabby, heroin-ravaged dystopia we saw in the original.\nTrainspotting arrived at a brief moment in British politics and culture that was infused with energy and optimism. Its follow-up reflects the Britain of today: a divided nation plagued by uncertainty.\nIt's not a complete downer though, scenes involving bodily fluids, casual violence and incompetent housebreaking providing uproariously funny punctuation to the generally melancholy mood.\nT2 Trainspotting won't leave you floating on air. But it will leave you with a smile on your face, a tear in your eye, and a trickle of its predecessor's old adrenaline coursing through your veins.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It's caused a lot of trouble between the SFA and Scottish Disability Sport. I just concentrate on the football side of it and that's all we ever want to do. The politics in sport have overtaken that and it's now interrupted the sport and it shouldn't do that.\n\"Everybody is just in utter shock. Most people don't do anything outwith the team, so that's all they've got to look forward to and that's why they train.\n\"I don't think we should be disadvantaged because of this rule. We got over the disappointment of losing David to go to England.\n\"We put that to one side and we just focused on everybody that is there and who's willing to commit to the programme and it's a shame that the boys are left with nothing at the moment.\n\"The SFA have been great over the years for us, they've given us the kit, we've travelled the world, we're treated professionally but this just feels like we're treated like second class citizens because it would not happen [with] the first team, it wouldn't happen, even the under-21s.\n\"I look at the women's squad, they've been funded full-time to go to the European Championships and they fully deserve it but we've never had that support.\n\"Can we go further? Can we kick on? Can we get better? That's something that's been really disappointing for me because I can see us getting to that level, but we need everything else in the pipeline to make it work.\"\nGavin Macleod, of Scottish Disability Sport, shares Paterson's disappointment that Scotland will not, as things stand, feature at the World Championships but believes the IFCPF may change their stance.\n\"We're already in dialogue with the International Federation,\" said Macleod. \"They are showing a willingness to address the policy and to look at it from a UK perspective and to protect the interests of the home nations, including Scotland so we have had a positive response.\n\"Early days, hopefully that will go in the correct direction.\n\"It's definitely not the end for the [Scotland] cerebral palsy football team. We're already making arrangements to ensure that they continue with their regular training sessions, the coaches are on board.\n\"We're working with the International Federation to try and ensure that we can get them back on the international calendar as soon as possible.\" \n",

With annual exports worth $4bn (\u00c2\u00a33.1bn), India is the largest exporter of beef, mostly buffalo meat, in the world.\nChief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar said in his order that \"the livelihood of people should not be affected by this\".\nPetitioners in Tamil Nadu had argued that the ban infringed their right to choose what they ate.\nAbdul Faheem Qureshi, the head of the Muslim All India Jamiatul Quresh Action Committee that supports meat sellers, who had lodged the petition with the Supreme Court, told Reuters news agency that the order was a \"victory\".\nMany states have actively started enforcing bans on cow slaughter after the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party formed India's federal government in 2014.\nThe western state of Gujarat passed a law in March making the slaughter of cows punishable with life imprisonment. In addition to government bans, vigilante groups who portray themselves as protectors of cows have been active in several states.\nIn some cases, these groups have killed Muslim men they suspect of killing cows. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said last year that cow vigilante groups made him \"angry\", said again in June that killing in the name of cow protection was \"not acceptable\".\nHowever, this has not stopped attacks against cattle traders.\nMr Modi's critics say the new law is aimed at appeasing India's Hindu community. \n",

If people call Israel nasty, I to some degree agree. If people call Israel the devil incarnated, I think they are obsessed - they are mad. But this is still legitimate.\"\n\"But if they carry on saying that therefore there should be no Israel, that's where anti-Zionism becomes anti-Semitism, because none of them ever said after Hitler that Germany should cease to exist, or after Stalin that there should be no Russia.\"\n\"Saying that Israel should cease to exist, or should not have come into being, this is crossing the line.\"\nAmos Oz has won numerous awards for his books and has also commented widely on political issues. His latest novel, Judas, is a love story set in Jerusalem in 1959-60.\nIn February 2015, hundreds of UK artists signed a letter announcing they would take part in a cultural boycott of Israel. They said they would not accept professional invitations to Israel, or take any funding from organisations linked to the government.\nOther prominent artists - including writer JK Rowling and historian Simon Schama - later criticised the move as \"divisive and discriminatory\".\nOz told Newsnight he believes cultural boycotts of Israel are counter-productive.\n\"I think boycott is hurting the wrong people. The idea that all Israelis are villains is a childish idea. Israel is the most deeply divided, argumentative society. You'll never find two Israelis that agree with one another - it's hard to find even one who agrees with himself or herself.\"\n\"Boycott is the wrong way because it hardens the Israeli resistance, and it deepens the Israeli paranoia that the whole world is against us.\"\n\"Boycott was very effective in the case of South Africa. But you have to be very stupid to think the prescription - the medicine that worked very well against cholera -will also kill the plague.\n\"This is a kind of laziness - mental laziness. South Africa was bad. The Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories is bad, in a totally different way. You need a different prescription.\"\nAmos Oz was speaking to BBC Newsnight's Kirsty Wark.

They pay for the hire with their smartphones and then unlock it - sometimes using a QR code.\nAfter they have finished the journey, customers can leave the bike anywhere.\nThat has proved problematic at times, with bikes abandoned in remote locations where another rider is unlikely to find it or want it.\nMobike has tried to get around this problem by providing cash or credit rewards for users who hire these bikes, in the hope they will end up somewhere more accessible.\nAnd the huge uptake of the scheme has caused conflicts on both roads and pavements as cyclists vie for space to move around, especially in  Shanghai and Beijing.\nSimilar schemes have opened up in Hong Kong and Singapore with Ofo planning to launch in Cambridge in the UK. \n",

His solicitor, however, asked a detective constable to confirm that his client had made a full statement to the police at the first opportunity.\nThe police officer confirmed this was the case and agreed that the version of events laid out in that statement tallied with the police's understanding of what had happened.\nThe officer agreed that this appeared to be a \"single punch\" incident and that the case rested on whether this was an act of aggression or, as the accused claims, an act of self-defence.\nA large number of friends and relatives of the accused man watched from the public gallery, some of them weeping. \n",

Currently Wales shares a legal jurisdiction with England.\nPlaid Cymru AM, committee member and former assembly presiding officer Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas said: \"It's a legislative failure on the part of the imperial capital and its works.\"\nThe report also said the bill fails to put Wales on a par with Scotland and Northern Ireland in terms of powers and responsibilities, and criticised the speed that it passed through the House of Commons.\nThe Conservatives are represented on the committee by David Melding, an ex-deputy presiding officer.\nBut Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies broke with the committee's consensus to defend the Wales Bill as a \"landmark piece of legislation\".\nThe bill would \"offer greater clarity and accountability than ever before in the devolved era\", he said, and provide \"an opportunity to move on from constitutional affairs\".\nA Wales Office spokeswoman said: \"The UK government is committed to creating a stronger Wales within the United Kingdom.\n\"The Wales Bill will secure a stronger, clearer and fairer devolution and is based on the cross-party St David's Day agreement.\n\"The calls to introduce a separate legal jurisdiction would add costs and increase complexity and have been rejected by the government and opposition in parliament.\" \n",

Although there was no control group in this study, the researchers said the results showed a five to 20% improvement on previous studies of prostate cancer treatment.\nAnd cancer biopsy tests performed two years after the trial were found to be negative in 83% and 79% of the patients in the two groups.\nDr Brian Butler, from Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas, said it could change the way that cancer is treated.\n\"We may be able to inject the agent straight into the tumour and let the body kill the cancer cells.\n\"Once the immune system has knowledge of the bad tumour cells, if they pop up again, the body will know to kill them.\"\nKevin Harrington, professor of biological cancer therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said the results were \"very interesting\" but more research was needed.\n\"We would need a randomised trial to tell if this treatment is better than radiotherapy alone.\n\"The viruses used in this study cannot reproduce. Next generation viral therapies for cancer can selectively replicate in cancer cells, something that can kill the cancer cell directly, and also help spread the virus to neighbouring cancer cells.\n\"It would be interesting to see this approach used with viruses that could reproduce to see if it makes for a more effective treatment.\" \n",

He was detained alongside other syndicate members. The arrests were made in late April, but police only made it public late last week\nMr Yuan told the investigators he  made the  jellyfish by mixing three chemicals - alginic acid, ammonium alum and calcium chloride anhydrous - according to an official release (in Chinese) by Huzhou police on social media platform WeChat.\nOfficers say they found \"excessive levels\" of aluminium in the fake jellyfish - up to 800mg/kg, which is eight times of China's own legal limit.\nThe food and drug safety branch of Huzhou police said too much aluminium could result in bone and nerve damage, and potentially harm memory. They warned against pregnant women, children and the elderly consuming the substance.\nAlthough jellyfish can be poisonous they are considered something of a delicacy in China, described as both tasty and a good source of collagen.\nEspecially popular in the summer, jellyfish skin is sliced and served like a salad with various dressings.\nIt appears as if the wild jellyfish supply simply cannot cope with the demand.  Zhejiang's Metropolitan Express paper has reported on jellyfish farms in the province.  It quotes fish farmers  saying that half-a-kilo of jellyfish takes 40 days to raise, with the wholesale price at about 30-40 yuan.\nThis cost is halved with artificial jellyfish and for obvious reasons, the production time is far less.\nThe Huzhou police have issued guidance on how to spot the difference.\nArtificial jellyfish is tasteless with no smell and is tough to tear and has a texture similar to sellotape.\nThe real deal?  Quite the opposite.  It has a fishy smell, and is yellowish and colourful.\nIn November 2014, Huzhou police, again, caught three individuals selling fake jellyfish made from a similar chemical mixture.\nIn October 2013, police in central Hunan province broke another jellyfish syndicate.\nThat group is said to have made 40 tonnes of fake jellyfish, and the ringleader was sentenced to six months in jail. \n",

They will argue that it, along with other oversight reports, clears them of carrying out \"mass surveillance\" as their critics have claimed.\nThey have argued that the way they collect and then examine material is compliant with human rights obligations and the law. A central point of contention has been whether bulk access to traffic through cable taps was in itself a violation of privacy because of what it swept up. The Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) says that indiscriminate trawling for information would be unlawful but the way in which the intelligence agencies go about selecting and retaining material is proportionate and lawful.\nThose who brought the case will not give up - they will go to Strasbourg and the European court and have also raised questions about the IPT process itself. But they will be disappointed by today's ruling even if it did not come as a complete surprise.\nThe bodies bringing the case to tribunal argued that GCHQ's methods breached article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is the right to privacy, as well as article 10, which protects freedom of expression.\nBut the judges at the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) said the disclosures made during this case, which included the legal footing of the intelligence system's activities, had contributed to their decision that the intelligence agencies were not in breach of human rights.\nIn a written judgment, a panel of IPT judges said: \"We have been able to satisfy ourselves that as of today there is no contravention of articles 8 and 10 by reference to those systems.\n\"We have left open for further argument the question as to whether prior hereto there has been a breach.\"\nA government security source told the BBC: \"We are delighted that a third independent body has confirmed that GCHQ does not seek to carry out mass surveillance.\"\nJames Welch, legal director for civil rights organisation Liberty, said: \"So a secretive court thinks that secret safeguards shown to it in secret are an adequate protection of our privacy.\n\"The IPT cannot grasp why so many of us are deeply troubled about GCHQ's Tempora operation - a seemingly unfettered power to rifle through our online communications.\"\nAmnesty UK's legal advisor Rachel Logan said the government had \"managed to bluff their way out of the case\" by \"retreating into closed hearings and constantly playing the 'national security' card\".\n\"We have had to painstakingly drag out every detail we could from an aggressively resistant government.\"\nShe also said the IPT's ruling was a \"disappointing, if unsurprising, verdict from an overseer that was in part assessing itself\".\n\"The government's entire defence has amounted to 'trust us' and now the tribunal has said the same,\" she added.\n\"Since we only know about the scale of such surveillance thanks to Snowden, and given that 'national security' has been recklessly bandied around, 'trust us' isn't enough.\" \n",

What happens the next day or the day after?\"\nDr Mike Knapton from the British Heart Foundation said: \"Using the Munich Oktoberfest as a real world laboratory is a unique approach and has given us an insight into how heavy drinking over a short space of time can increase people's chances of having an abnormal heart rhythm. However, longer-term follow-up is needed to confirm if this type of drinking has a lasting effect in giving people potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.\n\"Extensive research has shown that alcohol consumption is associated with a range of diseases, including heart disease and cancer. Our advice is to drink in moderation, or no more than 14 units of alcohol per week.\" \n",

This includes the RSPCA's assessment of the kennel management of seized dogs, which as a result is on hold.\n\"We remain happy to support them in their attempts to find the best way to provide for the animals in their care in any way we can.\"\nCampaigners following Stella's case, made up of Wheldon Law, independent experts, and whistleblowers, said: \"The police have a duty of care to these dogs and the kennels have a responsibility to ensure that their welfare needs are met.\n\"The local authority, which licences kennels, are supposed to ensure that they are properly run and the RSPCA should investigate any suspected offences diligently.\n\"All of them should hang their heads in shame.\"\nTeignbridge District Council, the licensing authority for Foredowne Boarding Kennels, said the investigation remains active. \n",

He was sent back.\nMr Montes and his lawyers concede he did climb over the border fence, but only because he had been unfairly deported in the first place.\nThe case hinges on whether the 17 February encounter alleged by Mr Montes ever happened.\nIf not, then he was not protected under Daca, because he would have left the US without permission and then tried to re-enter illegally.\nThe DHS has already corrected one detail of its records - the department originally said Mr Montes' Daca enrolment had expired in 2015, but it acknowledged on Wednesday that his status was valid until 2018.\nHowever, the agency also said Mr Montes had \"lost his Daca status when he left the United States without [permission from immigration authorities] on an unknown date prior to his arrest\" by Border Patrol on 19 February.\nActivists have seized on the case to argue that the Trump administration is going back on its word not to deport more than 750,000 immigrants awarded Daca status.\nThey say Mr Montes may be the first \"Dreamer\", as Daca enrolees are known, deported under Mr Trump's presidency.\nUS District Judge Gonzalo Curiel presided last year over a lawsuit involving students who claimed fraud after paying to attend real estate seminars branded as Trump University.\nDuring the lawsuit, Mr Trump said Judge Curiel's \"Mexican heritage\" meant that he would not rule fairly in the case, because Mr Trump wanted to build a border wall between the US and Mexico.\nMr Trump was condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike for his attacks on the jurist, who was born in Indiana to Mexican parents.\nJudge Curiel later approved a $25m (\u00c2\u00a323.3m) settlement in the case, under the terms of which Mr Trump did not admit any wrongdoing.\nHis assignment to the Montes case is said to be purely coincidental, based on rules for the Southern District of California, which selects judges on a rotating schedule.\nJudge Curiel will be asked to decide whether US Customs and Border Protection should release information on Mr Montes' deportation to his lawyers.\nNo court date has been set. \n",

Fresh mutton on flight menu,\" joked Nadeem Farooq Paracha, a Dawn blogger and columnist, in a tweet.\nAnother journalist, Fasi Zaka, tweeted: \"PIA sacrifices a black goat before resuming ATR services, they take their historical nickname 'Please Inform Allah' (PIA) very seriously.\"\nTelevision anchor Ejaz Haider tweeted: \"When Charles Perrow was working on his theory of normal accidents, he totally missed out on 'kala bakra' [black goat] as a hedge against accidents.\"\nMeanwhile, one Twitter user by the name of MisBis spoke for many when she wrote: \"There's nothing wrong in giving Sadqa [sacrificial offering]\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Sadqa bari balao se bachata hai [it hedges against many troubles]\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 stop making it a joke\".\nPIA had 11 ATR-42 planes in its fleet - the one that crashed in the Havelian region on 7 December killed all those on board.\nDays later, the pilot of another ATR had to abort take-off due to a malfunction in one of the engines, leading PIA to ground the rest of its ATRs for tests.\nThis affected PIA operations to smaller destinations such as Chitral, Gilgit, Gwadar and many other destinations in Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab where small air strips and lack of technical cover do not allow larger planes to land.\nDid Sunday night's sacrifice help?\nAll we can say is the flight departed safely for Multan, and later returned to Islamabad. \n",

There is no minister who was ever appointed by the Guptas.\"\nThe speaker ordered opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) leader Mmusi Maimane to leave the chamber for breaching parliamentary rules, prompting the party's MPs to walk out in solidarity with him.\nEarlier, Mr Maimane said power had shifted from the government to the Guptas.\n\"You and your family are getting richer while South Africans are getting poorer,\" he told Mr Zuma.\nThe party said in a statement that Mr Zuma's position was becoming \"increasingly untenable\", and he should resign or be sacked by the governing party.\nThe left-wing Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party boycotted the parliamentary session, saying it did not recognise Mr Zuma as leader of South Africa.\nAnalysis: Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg\nPresident Zuma's simple denial of his toxic relationship with the Gupta family seemed to sum up the view held by many here, that he is not fully engaged in running the country.\n\"Deny, deny, deny\" is the same strategy the 73-year-old employed when he came under fire over the use of government money to upgrade his private home in the rural area of Nkandla - until he was forced to make a U-turn when the opposition took him to South Africa's highest court.\nThe court is yet to make a ruling on whether he breached his oath of office by failing to repay the money, despite an anti-corruption watchdog finding that he had \"unduly benefited\" from the renovations.\nIn parliament, Mr Zuma seemed detached from the crisis gripping South Africa.\nNor did the speaker, a senior member of the governing party, inspire confidence in South Africa's 22-year-old democracy when she threw out opposition leader Mmusi Maimane, as he challenged the president.\nThe opposition has long accused Mr Zuma of letting the Guptas wield excessive influence.\nThe Guptas, who arrived in South Africa from India in 1993, have huge interests in computers, air travel, energy, and technology.\nThey said Mr Jonas' statement was political point-scoring.\nIn 2013, there was an outcry after a private jet carrying guests to the wedding of a Gupta family member was allowed to land at a South African military air force base in Pretoria.\nThe opposition has said that links between President Zuma and the Guptas were so close that they have been nicknamed the \"Zuptas\". \n",

Everyone is saying a Haye early knockout but I think it will be a tough fight for him.\"\nBermondsey-born Haye was cheered by a big crowd at Friday's weigh-in as he prepares to fight at a venue just six miles from where he grew up.\nOnly once in his 30-fight career has he weighed in heavier than for this bout.\nThe former WBA heavyweight champion mocked the physique of Bellew, who said he was \"over the moon\" to see his rival so heavy.\nBellew, who as recently as 2013 was fighting two weight classes lower, reiterated his belief Haye would be short on stamina in just his third fight since returning from over three years out of the sport.\nWoodhall believes Haye will be \"extremely dangerous\" early in the fight and expects Bellew to build his tactics around dragging a knockout specialist - who has been in just three 12-round contests - into the latter rounds.\n\"It's a classic case of who will land the big shot,\" added 1988 Olympic bronze medallist Woodhall.\n\"Bellew's first goal will be to get through the first four rounds, when we know Haye is at his most explosive. If he gets through he will not be home and dry by any means but his fight will then start and he can think about trying to break Haye down.\n\"The one thing against Haye is he's only fought a couple of times since 2012. I think he will solely rely on getting Bellew out early.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHaye has been criticised for graphic descriptions of how he intends to hurt his opponent, while Bellew has actively pursued the fight, calling his foe out publicly from the ring after a routine win in October.\nThe feud has meant both fighters have been kept apart by security in fight week, and the pre-fight face-off was also conducted with people between them.\nBritish Boxing Board of Control general secretary Robert Smith has expressed his disappointment in their behaviour.\n\"When it's all over, they will look back and neither one of them will be proud of beforehand,\" added Woodhall, 48. \"You have to have a balance. We all want the fight to sell but you don't want people pointing the finger at the sport of boxing.\n\"Psychologically, I think Bellew has played a blinder. Haye has to control his emotions early on. If he ends up swinging early on, missing the target, then the tide turns. I think Bellew wants Haye to come out very aggressively.\"\nHaye is attempting to improve his record of 28 wins from 30 fights, while Bellew has 28 wins, two losses and one draw on his record.\nThe bitterness between Haye and Bellew has been mirrored by super-lightweight rivals Derry Mathews and Ohara Davies.\nThe pair have engaged in insulting social media exchanges and expletive-laden rants before a bout which is the biggest of Davies' 14-fight career, and could help 33-year-old Mathews keep hopes of another world-title shot alive.\nWoodhall expects the welterweight fight between Sam Eggington and American Paulie Malignaggi to potentially steal the show.\nMalignaggi, 36, has been a world champion at two weights and has shared a ring with stellar names such as Amir Khan, Adrian Broner and Danny Garcia.\nWales' IBF featherweight champion Lee Selby will contest a non-title bout against Spain's Andoni Gago, while Ireland's London 2012 Olympic champion Katie Taylor enters her third fight as a professional when she faces Italy's Monica Gentili, who has six wins and as many losses in her career. \n",

He's just secured funding from a USA diabetes charity for some exciting research into the \"smart insulin\" concept.\nDr Fossey and his team have used some very clever chemistry to create a gel that only dissolves in the presence of glucose. Indeed he showed me how his gel disappears in a glucose solution while just sitting there in ordinary water.\nThe idea is to load up the gel with insulin, then as the glucose levels rise in someone with diabetes, the gel dissolves and the insulin is released into their system.\nIt would be an alternative to the current methods where a diabetic has to carry out blood tests, work out the right dose of insulin and then inject it. With the gel, the chemistry does all this automatically.\nImagine you are a parent to a young child with type 1 diabetes and they want to go on a sleepover. Sadly the parent hosting the party is not comfortable overseeing the blood testing and insulin injections your child will need. Well with this gel you could inject your kid once, perhaps under the arm, and the gel would take care of everything. It might even be possible to reduce injections to just one a week.\nOther teams are trying something similar, but Dr Fossey believes his gel has unique chemistry that makes it the best prospect for this sort of approach.\nIt is very early stages in the research though. The USA diabetes charity funding lasts for two years. After they've worked out the chemistry, the project will then move into a biology lab and then eventually, in about 10 years, we might see clinical trials in humans.\nThat's assuming it all goes well.\nSo it is a long-term research project, but those involved in diabetes research say this is a really exciting potential new treatment.\nYou can read more about Dr Fossey's work here. \n",

A clever pick up and offload by Darren Sweetnam saw full-back Conway cross the line.\nBoth teams pursued an attacking and expansive brand of rugby. The Blues turned down a very kickable penalty for out-half Gareth Anscombe in favour of a kick into the corner.\nJames got his second try of the game following a scintillating line break by Rey Lee-Lo. The Samoan found the international winger on his inside shoulder as the Blues secured a 17-10 half-time lead.\nThe introduction of Ireland internationals CJ Stander and Donnacha Ryan early in the second half gave the home team renewed impetus. The forwards' pressure was rewarded with a try in the 62nd minute when Kilcoyne barrelled over after 12 phases on the Bues' try-line.\nDanny Wilson was also able to call on some experienced heads on the bench. Wales captain Sam Warburton made his first appearance and played his part in what was an end-to-end encounter.\nBlues regained the lead with their first meaningful attack of the half.

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: About 85,000 German-language copies of the anti-Semitic Nazi manifesto have been sold. Publisher Andreas Wirsching said \"the figures overwhelmed us\".\nHe is director of the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich.\nBut the sales are well below those of best-sellers in Germany. It is an academic edition, costing \u00e2\u201a\u00ac58 (\u00c2\u00a349).\nAt the end of January the IfZ will launch a sixth print run. The book contains critical notes by scholars.\nUnlike the Nazi-era editions, the IfZ's Mein Kampf (My Struggle) has a plain white cover - without a picture of Hitler. The swastika and other Nazi symbols are banned in Germany.\nMr Wirsching told the German news agency DPA that the IfZ was planning a shorter, French-language edition. \"But two-thirds of our commentaries will be translated\" for it, he said.\nThe first print run in Germany in 2016 was 4,000 copies.\nLife of Adolf Hitler\nAustria MPs vote to seize Hitler's house\nHimmler diaries show daily Nazi horrors\nLiving with a Nazi name\nThe decision to republish the inflammatory book was criticised by Jewish groups. Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power.\nIt sets out racist ideas that the Nazis put into practice later, including the denigration and oppression of Jews and Slavs.\n'Not a runaway hit' - the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin writes:\nThe fact that the Nazi manifesto reached number one in Der Spiegel's non-fiction charts in April is cited as evidence that Adolf Hitler's propaganda is making a comeback in Germany.\nBut the term \"best-seller\" does not necessarily mean very much. A quarter of all books sold in Germany are bought in the run-up to Christmas. At other times of the year it is possible to top listings with relatively few sales.\nMein Kampf (My Struggle) is an expensive academic text, and is being bought by libraries, schools and history academics.\nFor a German non-fiction book sales of 85,000 are not bad. But the figures don't indicate a runaway hit.\nThe current biggest non-fiction seller is The Hidden Life of Trees, a book about the ecosystem of woodland, which has sold half a million copies so far.\nRead Damien's analysis in full here.\nAfter Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945, the Allied forces handed the copyright to the state of Bavaria. Under German law copyright lasts for 70 years.\nWhile the Bavarian regional government held the copyright, reprinting of the book was banned. But the copyright expired a year ago.\nMr Wirsching said he favoured \"clever\" teachers using the IfZ edition in the classroom. He warned against \"repeating the absurd 1950s discussion, when people said 'it was all Hitler's fault'.\"\nHe said the IfZ had obtained solid legal advice before republishing the book on a limited scale. And the scholarly edition was aimed partly at pre-empting any editions put out by Nazi sympathisers.\n\"It would be irresponsible to just let this text spread arbitrarily,\" he told DPA. \n",

Unlike League of Legends, it's based on Chinese historical characters. It's also specifically designed for play on a mobile platform.\nThis is a key reason it's so popular in China, where many gamers don't have access to a games console or PC at home.\nThe app is free to download, but players pay to upgrade their characters or costumes to help them advance to the next level.\nEstimates about how much an average player spends vary from about $1.50 to $6 a month.\nThat doesn't sound like much, but it all adds up in a game with more than 50 million monthly active users.\nParents and teachers worry that children are becoming addicted to the game.\nWhile hand-wringing over gaming is nothing new, Honour of Kings has drawn particular scorn from the government-owned People's Daily newspaper, which called it \"poison\" and a \"drug\" that harms teenagers.\nIt also called for tighter regulatory controls of online games.\nTencent's revenue model depends on getting existing gamers to spend more time on their products.\nIts last annual report says its strategy is to turn casual gamers into \"midcore\" or \"hardcore\" gamers.\nTencent made $7.2bn in the first quarter of this year, and more than half - about $3.9bn - came from gaming.\nTwo titles dominate its catalogue. League of Legends is its biggest title globally, but in China Honour of Kings is its highest grossing mobile game.\nChinese gaming industry database CNG estimates the game generated about $810.5m in the first quarter of this year. That would equate to about 11% of its total revenue.\nTencent is a huge company. Besides gaming it's in payment services, social media and messaging apps (notably the phenomenally successful WeChat).\nThe great majority of Tencent's business is in China, so it's vulnerable to regulatory changes there.\nThis could add to investor anxiety.

They're from the war and crisis torn zones of North Africa and Asia - they're Libyans and Somalis, Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis.\nAsk yourself this, though. Where are they trying to come to Britain from? France, of course but, before they reached, Calais they had to come through other EU countries. If they came over the sea from Africa they probably came through Italy or Greece. If over land they may have come through Hungary which, believe it or not,  is currently taking in more asylum seekers than Italy.\nIn other words this crisis risks being seen as not an isolated issue about the Anglo-French border but as yet another another symptom of Europe's failing immigration system which, before the past few days, was highlighted by so many tragic deaths in the Mediterranean.\nThis flow of humanity which the authorities in so many countries illustrate the pull of Europe and Britain in particular for many whose lives are blighted by war and persecution or just - just? - by poverty, disease and hardship who can now see and hear about the prospect of a better life on their smartphones or on Facebook or Twitter.\nIt highlights the challenges posed by a wealthy bloc of countries whose immigration controls are only as strong as the weakest link in the borders of 28 nations and which allows people who make it through to pass their way across a continent with minimal or no checks at all.\nAll the polling evidence shows that what made immigration the issue people cared about most again and again in recent years was not opposition per se to allowing people to come to the UK. It was the widespread sense that the system was out of control and, therefore, unfair.\nListen to the voices of bewilderment and anger in Calais and Dover yesterday and you'll see that this story has the capacity to cut through in the way few have since the general election.\nThat is why the prime minister spoke today of \"totally unacceptable scenes\" which was his way of trying to say - \"I get it\". \n",

The mocking tone and  the questions about money making from Wilson's memoirs so enraged the former Prime Minister that it wasn't shown on the BBC for 42 years.  It's now been shown in full on BBC Parliament.\nRay Winstone and Phil Daniels starred in a violent tale about a young offenders institute.  The violence, gang rape and racism were too much for the BBC controller Billy Cotton who banned it in 1977.  It was finally shown in 1991.  The film that followed it and caused a similar level of disquiet was The Firm about football hooligans.  It was subjected to a number of cuts before it was shown but still caused a furore.  It's now on the BBC store.\nAt the time it was a jolly jape with Prince Edward and Princess Anne as team captains in a royal celebrity version of \"It's a Knockout'.\nToyah, George Lazenby, Su Pollard, John Travolta, John Cleese and Meatloaf all took part in the programme that has never been repeated.  The show was anything but regal.\nThere is also the now very uncomfortable presence of Stuart Hall - the presenter has been convicted for a string of sexual assaults on young girls.

But what time a country wakes up seems to have little effect on sleep duration.\nProf Daniel Forger, one of the researchers, said there was a conflict between our desire to stay up late and our bodies urging us to get up in the morning.\nHe told the BBC News website: \"Society is pushing us to stay up late, our [body] clocks are trying to get us up earlier and in the middle the amount of sleep is being sacrificed; that's what we think is going on in global sleep crisis.\n\"If you look at countries that are really getting less sleep then I'd spend less time worrying about alarm clocks and more about what people are doing at night - are they having big dinners at 22:00 or expected to go back to the office?\"\nThe study also showed women had about 30 minutes more per night in bed than men, particularly between the ages of 30 and 60.\nAnd that people who spend the most time in natural sunlight tended to go to bed earlier.\nA strong effect of age on sleep was also detected. A wide range of sleep and wake-up times was found in young people but \"that really narrows in old age,\" said Prof Forger.\nDr Akhilesh Reddy, from the University of Cambridge, told the BBC: \"I think it's interesting; there's been a trend for these studies using data from twitter and apps and finding interesting correlations across the world we've never been able to do by putting people in sleep lab.\n\"It highlights that although our body clocks are programming us to do certain things, we can't as we're ruled by social circumstances.\n\"We won't know the long-term consequences of this for many years.\"\nDisrupted sleep in shift workers has been linked to a range of health problems, including type 2 diabetes.\nDr Reddy said the next wave of studies would gather data from activity and sleep monitors and \"that's where the future of this is\".\nFollow James on Twitter. \n",

Since then, peace deals have alternated with renewed violence.\nAl-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) was quick to claim responsibility for the attack.

The Indian Meteorological Department said Wednesday recorded the worst smog and visibility in 17 years.\nLevels of tiny particulate matter (known as PM 2.5) that enter deep into the lungs reached as high as 800 micrograms per cubic metre in the past four days, data from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee showed.\nDelhi chokes after Diwali fireworks\nDiwali in Delhi: Pollution in pictures\nCrass, loud, meaningless: Why have we ruined Diwali like this?\nThat is 30 times a mean guideline set by the World Health Organisation (WHO) of 25 micrograms per cubic metre on average over a 24-hour period.\nAnumita Roychowdhury of the Centre for Science and Environment said the situation \"demands emergency response\".\n\"The government should aggressively inform all and advise them to stay indoors and avoid outdoor exercises,\" she said.\nThe BBC spoke to some Delhi residents about how they were coping with such alarming levels of pollution.\nI am 11 years old and I love to play football like most of my friends. But I haven't been able to play properly since Sunday. I feel tired and breathless in 20 minutes and then I just go back to my house.\nMy friends feel the same. We feel we have no stamina left.\nEarlier, we could play for hours without any problem. We are thinking that we should stop playing outdoors completely until the air becomes better.\nIt's so sad. Why do people set off fireworks? We don't need them. People need to know that our health is more important than fireworks. Please stop this madness.\nI have been an auto-rickshaw driver for more than 20 years but this is the first time I have seen such thick smog after Diwali. I am 55-years old and I cannot take such pollution at this age.\nThe government forced us to use compressed natural gas (CNG) for tuk-tuks to reduce pollution. I find it so ironic that we use greener fuel, but suffer the most due to pollution.\nTuk-tuks are open and that is why I have been literally breathing smog since Diwali. My eyes itch and I frequently feel breathless. But I can't rest because I have to earn every day for my family.\nI hope people stop setting off fireworks. It is a relatively new phenomenon, we only used to have lamps earlier. Diwali is about peace, not pollution.\nIt's sad when parents make WhatsApp groups to discuss which are the best face masks for children. We are talking about six year olds here.\nSchools are curtailing sports activities. Many friends are taking sudden vacations to get out of Delhi and escape the pollution. But not all of us can run away from here.\nSo to cope with the pollution, we wear masks when outside. Keeping our doors and windows shut and using multiple air purifiers at home helps to a certain degree.\nEven with all these precautions, many children, specially those facing breathing problems or persistent coughs, need daily nebulisation.\nI haven't been able to send my two sons out to play since Diwali.\nShilpa Kannan is a BBC journalist\nI am a businessman and I have to meet several people every day. But I have consciously tried to not go out much because of the smog since Diwali.\nI feel breathless even inside my car. I can't keep the windows of my house open. Delhi has become a gas chamber and nobody seems to be doing anything to improve the situation.\nWe as a family don't set off fireworks and request other people to do the same, but then not many listen.\nI am thinking of buying air purifiers for my office and home, but that's not a permanent solution. People really have to understand that we have made the city a ticking time bomb.\nBut fireworks can't be blamed as the main contributor to pollution. Vehicle emission, dust coming from construction sites and smoke coming from burning of crop stubble in farms all contribute to Delhi pollution and the government needs to have a strict policy to deal with these issues. \n",

He said:\n\"Pembrolizumab looks like it has potential to be a paradigm shift for cancer therapy.\"\nOne of his patients, Warwick Steele, aged 64, has been receiving infusions of pembrolizumab every three weeks since October.\nBefore the treatment started he could barely walk because the melanoma had spread to one of his lungs and he found it hard to breathe.\n\"I got tired simply standing up and was literally too exhausted to shave.  But now I feel back to normal and can do gardening and go shopping\".\nScans of his lungs - shown above -  reveal that after just three infusions, the drug appears to have completely cleared the cancer from his lung.\nThe other drug, nivolumab, was tested in combination with an existing licensed immunotherapy, ipilimumab.\nIn a trial of 53 patients, survival was 85% after one year, and 79% after two years.\nJohn Wagstaff, Prof of medical oncology at Swansea College of Medicine is part of a larger trial of these two drugs.\nHe said: \"I am convinced that this is a breakthrough in treating melanoma.\n\"The trial is still \"blinded\" so we don't know what treatments the patients are getting, but we have seen some spectacular responses.\"\nProfessor Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: \"It's exciting to see the range of new treatments that are emerging for people with advanced melanoma.\"\nBut doctors are urging caution.  The results which have been published are of Phase I, early stage trials.\nMuch larger Phase III trials are underway involving many UK hospitals.\nOnly when they report, in about a year's time, can clinicians be sure what the likely benefits will be.\nLike all drugs, the experimental treatments have side effects.

They argued that this was a later burial site, and not the original scene of his murder.\nThis \"burial theory\" may explain some perplexing facts about Oetzi.\nFor example, analysis suggests he died in the spring because the pollen of plants that bloom at that time of year is found in his gut. However, pollen within the ice suggests that the corpse was deposited in the late summer.\nProfessor Bondioli and his team say that these facts makes most sense if the body was deliberately carried to its site of discovery many months after death.\nThis suggests a burial.\nProfessor Bondioli elaborated: \"Oetzi must have been a very important person to be taken to this high mountain pass for burial. Perhaps he was some sort of a chieftain.\"\nNot bullet proof\nHowever, Professor Frank Ruehli of the University of Zurich, the medical doctor who performed the original autopsy, is not totally convinced by the burial theory.\nHe remarked: \"The left arm of the corpse is in a weird position. This must have happened at the time of death.\"\n\"If Oetzi was a chieftain, why did his people not move the twisted arm into a more natural position?\" he told BBC News. \"This would be expected in the burial of an important person\".\nAlso somewhat sceptical is Dr Wolfgang Muller of Royal Holloway University of London. He studied the chemistry of Oetzi's teeth and bones to track his migration route through the Alps.\n\"It's an interesting new interpretation but it's not bullet proof,\" he said. \"However, if Oetzi was buried they must have carried the body a long way because the nearby villages would have been at a low altitude.\"\nWhile much remains to be learned about the enigmatic Iceman - as the mummified corpse has been dubbed - one thing is certain: This famous mummy will remain the subject of intense speculation and new research for decades to come. \n",

Betis romped home 5 - 0. David took on Goliath and the result was history.\nAnd on went Don Patricio, joining Barcelona just before the Spanish Civil War broke out.\nThe club was so associated with the republican cause that it almost folded under the pressure from General Franco's forces.\nBut in 1937, Mr O'Connell led the team into exile on a tour of Mexico and New York.\nThe money raised on the odyssey was used to revive the team's fortunes.\nHe became known as the saviour of Barcelona.\nMr O'Connell left shortly afterwards. Years later, in 1954, his old glory team, Betis heard he had hit hard times and arranged a benefit match.\nThe last years were hard. In London, he died of pneumonia in 1959. His grave remains unmarked.\nFergus Dowd learned about Dublin man Mr O'Connell at his father's knee.\n\"I remember the story of the hero and the tragedy of his life,\" he said.\n\"Remember, without him there would be no Barcelona - no Messi, no Cruyff, no Maradona. It was O'Connell who saved Barcelona from extinction.\"\nAnd now a group of fans and football stars and clubs want to mark his place in soccer history in a more fitting way.\nThey want a memorial at his grave and a monument at the Park Centre in Belfast, Northern Ireland - scene of his first professional matches.\nFor Fergus Dowd, it has been amazing.\n\"It has been unbelievable - we've had responses from all over Europe. The top people in football have been involved,\" he said.\n\"We now have 30 signed shirts from everyone from Cruyff to Beckenbauer. Gerry Armstrong gave us his 1982 Northern Ireland jersey and we have a jersey signed by the greatest Ireland 11 - including Roy Keane.\"\nNow, with the help of soccer players and fans, Mr O'Connell's unmarked grave at St Mary's Cemetery, Kensal Road, London will be a tribute to the man they called \"Barcelona's saviour\". \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: The tower tourists call Big Ben glows in the early autumn sunshine. The pavements around Parliament heave with visitors snapping pictures of the mighty clock. From Seoul to Spain it's seen as the symbol of British government. Stable, solid, timeless.\nAs Orwell described England in 1941.... \"it is continuous, it stretches into the future and the past, there is something in it that persists, as in a living creature.\"\nBut nothing is the same.\nWestminster's politicians are dazed and disorientated. They feel politics as they know it is cracking up. The main parties are scrambling to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom.\nThe sleepy assumption that separation would never happen has vanished.  If it happens, Westminster will soon lose its 59 Scottish MPs.\nThe political damage to David Cameron and Ed Miliband would be immense.\nIf Scotland stays, a shift of new powers from London to Edinburgh is promised. The rest of Britain will be rewired too. It seems inevitable there will be a devolution of power within England. The remaining Scottish MPs in Westminster would surely lose their right to vote on English matters. The so-called West Lothian Question would need to be answered. The constitutional obsessions of political scientists are no longer niche. They're pressing and urgent.\nThe crack up has been brewing for several years. Not just the decades' long gestation of Scottish separatism. But in the fading confidence of Westminster's politicians.\nThe expenses scandal of 2009 was memorable not just for the ludicrous receipt-free claims and care-free sense of entitlement to public money. It was memorable too for the raw fury it unleashed among voters.\nThe public's trust in politicians had been falling for years. For many voters the scandal exposed a vacuity at the heart of British politics and sealed their contempt for politicians.\nWhen UKIP's leader Nigel Farage condemns the Westminster political establishment he echoes a recruiting message of the Yes campaign in Scotland.\nThere are big differences between the SNP, the Yes movement and UKIP. But both parties are nationalist and both promise a rejection of politics as usual. They're tapping a deep disillusionment with Westminster politics. And they're both posing an electoral nightmare for the three main parties whose memberships have been in sharp decline for years. Together they have fewer members than the RSPB.\nAs Labour is discovering in Scotland - it isn't possible to mobilise huge blocks of supporters if the party members and foot-soldiers aren't there anymore.\nIt's not an original observation that Westminster politics has a so-called \"professional political class\" at its heart - people who were familiar with the ways of Westminster long before they were elected. Voters have sussed this out. Not dogmatic or interested enough to join a political party themselves they find the entrances to politics blocked.\nShrinking political parties remain the gateways to council seats and the green benches. Politicians claim the media plays its part in sowing disillusionment with the difficult business of doing politics.\nThe referendum has electrified politics in Scotland and prompted profound questions in Westminster.\nIs the rise of English nationalism now inevitable or will greater regional devolution extinguish the UKIP surge?\nAre we seeing a nationalist reaction to the forces of globalisation? Can political parties as we've known them survive?\nHow should we be governed and where should power lie? While the main parties panic about Scotland they're also looking anxiously at the future. Everything looks the same but Westminster politics will never be the same again. \n",

Not many tiger attacks in the UK are there?\n\"When I think about the manner of Sarah's death, what makes me most upset is thinking about how scared she would have felt.\n\"It's not like dying of an illness when you have time to come to terms with it, or a car crash when you're dead the minute you hit the ground.\n\"She would have seen a tiger coming towards her, in an area where she thought she was alone. She didn't die instantly so she would have felt every bite or scratch or whatever it did,\" he said.\nTo add to the family's shock there was confusion in the immediate aftermath of the mauling as to whether Miss McClay had been in an area where she should not have been.\nBut early on in the Cumbria Police investigation, it was established Miss McClay was in a permitted staff area and Padang somehow got in through a door which should not have been open.\nBecci May, regional manager of tigers and Asian species, for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said tiger attacks on people were rare.\n\"Normally they run a mile - it can be hard to see a tiger in the wild, they keep out of people's way.

He has been living at the zoo for almost a decade.\nMr McClay remembers his sister, who was originally from Glasgow, and who had worked as a zookeeper at the park for four years, as a happy, pragmatic woman with \"modest dreams\" of helping animals.\n\"She loved her work and all animals - especially red squirrels - and she would have loved to have been in charge of her own conservation project some day.\"\nFollowing the inquest, the family awaits the outcome of a health and safety investigation by Barrow Borough Council.\nThe family has always been adamant that Padang should not be harmed.\n\"I don't feel like I want any kind of retribution against the animal itself,\" Mr McClay explained. \n",

She helped set up an art therapy space in a community centre close to the Grenfell Tower in the days after the blaze.\nShe said: \"The children just have some art materials and they're free to do whatever they want to.\n\"That's been enormously helpful in this crisis and trauma whereby the children are just allowed a space to process their feelings through the art when words really aren't enough or even possible quite a lot of the time.\"\nShe added: \"The tower features in a lot of their drawings because it's there, it's everybody's eye shot. It's in everything, it's everywhere we look, it's everywhere we go.\n\"But also there's a lot of other stuff, there's indescribable things, a lot of mess-making, a lot of stuff that's just processing which isn't pretty pictures or even horrible pictures, it's just something in the art materials themselves that really make it possible for the children to process some of their feelings in a very visceral way.\"\nBack in Edinburgh, nine-year-old Wahaj, has been making a clay mask. He wants to give it to his cousin as a thank you present for fixing one of his games.\n\"I think it's better because if you sit there forever, it makes you feel bored,\" he said. \"But over here when you're doing stuff, making stuff like masks is more fun.\"\nArt therapist Eilidh Gilbertson said they have good results from their work.\n\"If something terrible's happened they can make an image that responds to that where they don't have the words to communicate.\n\"This calms them down, they get to work with other children, they get to work with materials, it can relax them and calm them down a little bit.\" \n",

The smoke gave me serious chest pains and it burned my eyes.\n\"People were fighting and screaming all the time so I was petrified as some were dangerous.\n\"There were people who were very aggressive, there was no control and it made me very worried. I also couldn't speak Arabic so I didn't know what was going on or what the food was that we were given.\"\nMr Uddin was later transferred to a non-smoking cell, which held about 300 prisoners.\nHe said you could pay \u00c2\u00a33 a night for a two-inch thick mat that was the width of a single bed and shared by two people.\nHis family sent money to the jail so he could have a mat.\nHe said he would sometimes be thrown off the mat by other inmates, who treated him like a \"second-class citizen\" because he was unable to speak the language.\nThe cell was also very hot and they washed their clothes in the toilet sink or could pay 50p to have their clothes washed by the prison laundry service.\nMr Uddin had been on a two-week pilgrimage with his wife and children when he was arrested.\nHe said: \"The police beat me up. They were slapping me and punching me while one choked me by pulling very hard on the back of my collar like I was being hanged.\n\"I was then taken to hospital with facial injuries for three hours before being put in jail.\n\"I was begging the policeman saying I wouldn't press charges for being assaulted if they would just let me go because I was so worried about what my wife and children would do without me.\n\"When they still sent me to jail when I had done nothing wrong I felt very shocked. I felt very upset too when I found I had no human rights in there.\"\nDuring his 10 months away, Mr Uddin's family had to sell his takeaway business because it accrued so many debts while it remained shut.\nHe has also had to re-sit his taxi licence exam because it had elapsed,  and he nearly lost his house.\nHe now has nightmares that he is still in the jail or that he cannot return home,  and said the trauma had taken a psychological toll on his children.\nMr Uddin finally returned to Edinburgh three weeks ago.\n\"We didn't celebrate, the trauma had been too great, we just felt huge relief,\" he said.\nMr Uddin said he was disappointed with the lack of help from the Foreign Office and from the Blackhall Mosque officials who organised the trip to Mecca.\nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: \"Our staff provided assistance to a British national in Saudi Arabia following their arrest in February 2016, including being in regular contact with their family and local authorities.\" \n",

He returned in the morning chill to play the par-five 18th and hit a wedge to three feet for a birdie to tie American Kevin Kisner for the 54-hole lead.\nIn the final round he opened a two-shot lead with birdies on the 10th and 11th and rolled in a 10-foot birdie putt on the 16th to move a comfortable three strokes clear.\n\"I always thought I was going to win a big one as my first one but this is going to take a long time to sink in,\" he said.\nAlthough the win gives him a European Tour exemption until the end of the 2018 season, Knox is not currently a member and is based on the PGA Tour in America.\nThis makes him ineligible for next year's Ryder Cup at Hazeltine but he said: \"Obviously it's going to be a goal of mine to make the European Ryder Cup team.\n\"But I have no idea where I stand or what I need to do to make the team. But I look forward to finding out and giving it a run.\"\nSpieth was three shots off the lead after the third round following a 63 but bogeyed the opening hole of his final round, with a 70 leaving him five shots behind Knox.\nIt was enough to depose PGA champion Jason Day at the top of the rankings, however.\nWorld number three McIlroy, troubled by food poisoning before the start of the tournament, retained his lead in the Race To Dubai standings after carding seven birdies on the final day to finish in a share of 11th place.\nAmerican Dustin Johnson had moved to within one of the lead at the Sheshan International Golf Club. His third shot at the par-five eighth hit the flagstick and rolled off into the water, resulting in a double bogey. He finished in a share of fifth.\nKisner made birdie on the 18th for a 70 to claim second, his fourth runner-up this year, the other three being play-off losses. \n",

In 2012, Cameron won two separate judgements against similar accusations.\nThe filmmaker has already announced two sequels to Avatar are already in pre-production.

Other demonstrations were banned.\n\"We were all happy when the war ended. But can we be happy with the developments post-war?\" Mr Sirisena said during commemorations on Tuesday.\n\"We were not able to win hearts and minds of people. The true reconciliation could only be achieved by winning hearts and minds.\"\nIn a statement issued on Sunday, Human Rights Watch expressed doubts about the new administration's commitment to address the allegations of human rights abuses and war crimes during the last stages of the civil war.\nMr Sirisena's remarks, however, are another sign of a changed emphasis since his unexpected election victory over the more nationalistic former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, in January, reports the BBC's Charles Haviland.\nOur correspondent says Mr Sirisena appears to be acknowledging that more remains to be discovered about how many Tamil civilians died or disappeared in murky circumstances - and about whether Tamil Tiger leaders were killed after surrendering.\nThere are also many more unsolved rights issues dating back decades.\nFor the past five years, the war's end was celebrated as \"Victory Day\" by the Rajapaksa government, but the new administration has said it will be observed as \"Remembrance Day\" to mark the sacrifices made by all those died, irrespective of their ethnicity, reports BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen.\nMonday's memorial event by Tamil politicians was another notable change.\nThe ceremony was conducted on the beach of Mullivaayikkal in Mulaithivu district where the final battle took place. The ceremony was attended by the Chief Minister of the Northern Province CV Vignaswaran and many other members of the provincial council.\nSince 30 years of civil war ended in May 2009, annual victory day military parades in Sri Lanka have been held with tanks and artillery, while fighter jets fly overhead.\nIn contrast, the Tamil community in the north and east was prevented from any attempts at public memorials. Political party offices and media institutions were surrounded by government troops and roads to some Hindu religious shrines closed in order to deny any attempts at commemoration.\nBut this year, things were different.\nMonday's ceremony at Mullivaayikkal was part of Remembrance Week, which began on 12 May. Several religious events were held throughout the north and east to commemorate the civilian lives lost.\nAccording to UN estimates, between 80,000 and 100,000 people were killed in the conflict. Some reports have suggested about 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the final few weeks.\nPeace campaigners have repeatedly warned against major victory celebrations that could further alienate the country's communities.\nMr Rajapaksa and his supporters commemorated the war anniversary separately on Monday and blamed the new government for not celebrating it as a victory. \n",

So many people go through it, people get raped, we need to deal better with it.\"\nShe said she would not have reported the crime if it was not for the fact a witness was filming the rape, footage she had to watch before being cross-examined in court.\n\"It was pretty horrible to watch. It was different to how I remembered it. But it wasn't nice to watch.\"\nAnd Miss Clark said she would not go through the legal process again - but urged other victims to report rape.\n\"My message is don't be discouraged by the system letting us down, or people being judgmental. That will happen regardless.\n\"We all know it's not our fault.

And many in the MBCT group had been tapered off their medication.\nScientists say these findings suggest MBCT could provide a much-needed alternative for people who cannot or do not wish to take long-term drugs.\nIn their report, they conclude it \"may be a new choice for millions of people with recurrent depression on repeat prescriptions.\"\nNigel Reed, who took part in the study, added: \"Mindfulness gives me a set of skills which I use to keep well in the long term.\n\"Rather than relying on the continuing use of anti-depressants, mindfulness puts me in charge, allowing me to take control of my own future, to spot when I am at risk and to make the changes I need to stay well.\"\nProviding an independent comment on the study, Dr Gwen Adshead, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: \"These findings are important from the point of view of people living with depression who are trying to engage in their own recovery.\n\"And it provides evidence that MBCT is an intervention that primary care physicians should take seriously as an option.\"\nBut he cautioned the research does not suggest MBCT is useful for all types of depression; nor that it should replace anti-depressant treatment for people with severe disorders who have needed hospital treatment or are suicidal.\nAnd experts caution patients should only reduce their anti-depressant medication under medical supervision.\nProf Eduard Vieta, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Barcelona, Spain, said there needed to be more studies to establish how effective MBCT might be.\nResearchers say their next step is to tease out what the active ingredient in mindfulness therapy might be, and to check it compares favourably to other group-based approaches. \n",

In terms of input to the process going forward, the exercise was largely redundant,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\n\"We need to have Indigenous communities get their head around the questions because there is a flux of models floating around and we haven't landed [on one].\n\"The [referendum] question should be about including indigenous people in the democratic process of this country.\"\nPat Dodson, West Australian Indigenous leader:\nMr Dodson said Australia's constitution was \"appallingly racist\" and had \"to be fixed\".\n\"We didn't come to concluded views on models or propositions but I do think we made a fair degree of progress on the steps that are needed to go forward,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\n\"These are complex moral and ethical issues for some people but I don't think we should be discriminating against anyone in this nation, and certainly not against Aboriginal people,\" he said.\nWill the referendum succeed?\nJoint Campaign Director of RECOGNISE, Tanya Hosch:\n\"The nation's leaders ultimately have to reach a consensus on a model that can win broad support,\" said Ms Hosch in a statement released on Monday.\n\"We applaud them for today's significant progress toward that goal.\n\"We've been able to put the issue on the radar of millions of Australians over the last three years but there are millions more who aren't yet aware of the basic issue - the lack of recognition of the first Australians and the discriminatory elements that remain in the Constitution.\"\nNational Congress of Australia's First Peoples, Kirstie Parker:\nMs Parker told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that it remained to be seen \"how much real listening was done\" at the summit.\n\"I will say this: that passionate is one thing. An unwillingness to hear what others have to say is regrettable and it is important that people treat each other with dignity and respect in this process, even if you have a difference of opinion.\"\nProtesters:\nIndigenous people not included in the meeting were angry about how the 40 representatives were chosen.\nThe meeting attracted about 50 protesters, some of whom rejected representation by the Indigenous leaders inside the meeting.\nIndigenous activist Ken Canning, who addressed the crowd, criticised Indigenous leaders who took part in the meeting.\n\"This is not just a meeting; this is an act of treason against their own people,\" Guardian Australia reported him as saying.\n\"They are legitimising everything he [Mr Abbott] has done [to Aboriginal people] by sitting down with him,\" Mr Canning said. \n",

Well, Mr Abe was hoping to get the international backing he needs to delay the much-anticipated consumption tax due to be implemented in 2017.\nThere are concerns that a consumption tax would hit spending - and that's something Mr Abe needs to ensure goes up so that prices start to move up too.\nHe had previously said the only two things that would cause him to delay a consumption tax next year are a natural disaster and a Lehman style shock to the world economy.\nJapan suffered a natural disaster recently with the Kyushu earthquake.\nAnd during the G7 summit, the prime minister had stressed that if fiscal stimulus isn't adopted, a Lehman style crisis could hit the world economy.\nHe wasn't able to convince his partners at the G7 of that.

Not for the first time I had to eat my words very publicly on air.\nMy judgement call had been wrong, but I hadn't pulled it out of thin air.\nAt the time of the broadcast, the talks seemed at an especially low ebb and negotiators from other parties were telling me they regarded Sinn F\u00e9in's latest demands on welfare reform as completely impractical.\nI didn't have just their hunches to go on, but also a Sinn F\u00e9in position paper which set out clearly the party's belief that there should be no reduction in any of the benefits under the executive's control.\nSo when the deal was announced, the ease with which the welfare logjam was broken seemed surprising.\nWe were briefed that many of the politicians' assumptions had turned out to be incorrect.\nThe new system of universal credit would cover circumstances that Sinn F\u00e9in had feared it wouldn't.\nSome of the numbers had been double-counted, making the perceived gap between Sinn F\u00e9in and the rest appear wider than it turned out to be.\nI scratched my head, made my on-air apologies and moved on.\nIf the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in were prepared to renew their marriage vows, who was I to object from the back of the church?\nBy this point, in common with many other commentators, I am drowning in the competing numbers surrounding the welfare stand-off and don't pretend to have the full picture.\nBut having been burned once, I am reluctant to accept the notion again that with an extra \u00a3200m or \u00a3300m thrown into the pot, all will be well.\nHere's one thing that puzzles me.\nThe so-called welfare fines levied by the Treasury are meant to represent the difference between what Northern Ireland would have saved if it had adopted the new benefit system and its projected expenditure if it sticks with the existing old system.\nBased on actual fines and Social Security Agency projected fines over the next five financial years, the executive should be paying a total of \u00a31.325bn.\nOver the same period, the resources allocated to the Stormont Castle top-up benefit scheme amount to \u00a3466m.\nI make that a gap of \u00a3859m, and that's without getting into the \u00a3705m estimate the Social Security Agency has given for the cost of setting up a bespoke Northern Ireland computer system.\nIf the parties do eventually cobble together a deal, no doubt some spin doctor will be able to baffle me with arithmetical calculations.\nIn the meantime, it might be Cheltenham week but I am continuing to put my short-lived career as a racing tipster on hold. \n",

That's one reason why Number 10 is adamant that she will not take part in TV debates. But two - it's not just down to her very different style, but also, as David Cameron learnt very quickly, front runners in any campaign have everything to lose in those debates, and the underdogs have everything to gain.\nDowning Street knows they will take a certain amount of flak for the decision not to play ball, and the opposition parties are of course relishing every opportunity to say that the PM is too frightened to defend her record.\nBut right now Mrs May's allies are willing to wear it, rather than broker the risk of taking part, even if the broadcasters go ahead with the programmes without her.\nWhat will you hear a lot of from the Tory leader? Well if her very first campaign visit is anything to go by, David Cameron and George Osborne's \"long-term economic plan\" mantra will be replaced by the phrase \"strong and stable\".\nOn the stump you'd be forgiven for losing count of the number of times she used the phrase. One totting-up puts it at 13 mentions.\nBrexit has undoubtedly set the backdrop for this election, and provided the catalyst for its timing. But the Conservatives plan to win to deliver their version of Brexit by again and again comparing what they claim is the \"strong and stable\" leadership provided by the sitting prime minister, and the alternative put forward by Jeremy Corbyn.\nTomorrow he'll make his first big election speech, his first big chance to recast that argument. \n",

The assembly might end up choosing a successor to Ayatollah Khamenei, who is 76 and has suffered ill-health.\nWhat is the Assembly of Experts?\nIran elections: Five things to know\nElections highlight divisions\nPunchy politics on social media\nEarly results gave Mr Rafsanjani, a moderate Conservative, and Mr Rouhani respectively the most votes for the assembly, which is composed of mostly elder and senior clerics.\nBy contrast, the leading candidate of Islamic hardliners, Ayatollah Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, was hovering near the bottom of the list.\nFor parliament, former Vice-President Mohammad Reza Araf was topping the list for the capital with almost half the votes counted there. The only conservative so far was former parliament speaker Gholamali Haddad-Adel, in seventh place.\nThe result is significant because lawmakers from the capital usually determine the political direction of the house, analysts say.\nHowever they add that the picture may be more mixed in smaller towns across the country.\nMr Rouhani said the election gave the government more credibility and clout.\n\"The competition is over. It's time to open a new chapter in Iran's economic development based on domestic abilities and international opportunities,\" the official Irna news agency quoted him as saying.\n\"The people showed their power once again and gave more credibility and strength to their elected government.\"\nVoting was extended three times on Friday as crowds reportedly flocked to polling stations. Turnout was more than 60%.\nReformists, who want better relations with the outside world and more freedoms at home, are hoping to gain influence in the conservative-dominated bodies.\nBut of 12,000 people who registered as candidates, only half were allowed to stand, including just 200 moderates.\nThe results of the parliamentary election could take longer to emerge than for the Assembly of Experts and the parliamentary vote is likely to go to a second round in April.\nCandidates need 25% of the vote to win outright and there is an average of 17 candidates per seat. Elected MPs will serve four-year terms.\nThis was the first election to be held since last year's deal between Iran and world powers over the country's nuclear programme and the lifting of sanctions.\nBBC Persian's Ali Hamedani says the economy was a key issue in the process.\nWith sanctions lifted and Western investors beginning to return to Iran, there are high hopes for an improvement in daily life, he says.\nReformists and moderates say they are targeting greater foreign investment which, our correspondent says, will create jobs for young people.\nMore than half of Iranians are under 35 but the youth unemployment rate is 25% - more than two and a half times the national average.\nHowever, conservatives say strong economic growth is more likely to come from domestic production in what they describe as a \"resistance economy\" that draws on the ideals of the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution. \n",

In our view, and in line with the chief inspector of schools, schools should provide a curriculum with an academically rigorous core for all, plus broader opportunities in the arts and sport.\n\"What schools and colleges offer should be driven by the needs of their students and communities, not by centrally set targets.\n\"Progress 8 has superseded the need for the EBacc. We would have preferred the government to let it quietly curl up and wither away.\"\nJohn Kampfner, chief executive of the Creative Industries Federation, said the government was continuing to pursue an \"ill thought through and short-termist\" policy.\n\"The creative industries have been identified as one of five priority sectors in the government's industrial strategy in recognition of their economic contribution,\" he said.\n\"However, the Department for Education has not answered the sector's concerns, by continuing to sideline creative education in favour of academic subjects.\"\nDeborah Annetts, founder and leader of the Bacc for the Future campaign, said the decision was short-sighted and misconceived.\n\"We would ask Justine Greening to meet with Bacc for the Future representatives as soon as possible so she can understand first-hand the damage this misguided policy is having.\n\"As the chief inspector of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman said last week, 'All children should study a broad and rich curriculum.'\n\"We need to create an education which is fit for the 21st Century and fit for our country post-Brexit.

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: The plane had no fuel on impact, an official said, corroborating audio of the pilot asking to land because of a fuel shortage and electric failure.\nThe capital Bogota was mentioned on the flight plan as a possible refuelling stop, but the plane did not land there.\nThe plane plunged into a mountainside near Medellin late on Monday.\nOnly six of the 77 people on board the plane survived.\n\"Having been able to do an inspection of all of the remains and parts of the plane, we can affirm clearly that the aircraft did not have fuel at the moment of impact,\" civil aviation chief Alfredo Bocanegra told a news conference.\nFreddy Bonilla, another aviation official, said regulations stipulated that aircraft must have 30 minutes of fuel in reserve to reach an alternative airport in an emergency, but \"in this case the plane did not have\" it.\n\"The engines are the electrical source... but without fuel, obviously the electrical source would have been completely lost,\" he added.\nIn a leaked tape, the pilot can be heard warning of a \"total electric failure\" and \"lack of fuel\". Just before the tape ends, he says he is flying at an altitude of 9,000ft (2,745m).\nThe plane was carrying the Brazilian football team Chapecoense, who had been due to play a cup final against Atletico Nacional in Medellin on Wednesday evening.\nThe team flew from Sao Paulo to Santa Cruz on a commercial flight, then switched to the chartered aircraft.\nBrazil's O Globo reported that because of a delayed departure, a refuelling stop in Cobija - on the border between Brazil and Bolivia - was abandoned because the airport did not operate at night.\nThe pilot had the option to refuel in Bogota, but headed straight to Medellin.\n\"The pilot was the one who took the decision,\" Gustavo Vargas, a representative of Lamia, which operated the plane, was quoted as saying in Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete. \"He thought the fuel would last.\"\nApproaching Medellin, the pilot asked for permission to land because of fuel problems, without making a formal distress call.\nBut another plane from airline VivaColombia had priority because it had already suffered a fuel leak, the co-pilot of another plane in the air at the time said.\nThe pilot of the crashed plane is heard asking urgently for directions to the airport before the audio recording ends.\nOfficials say the plane's \"black boxes\", which record flight details, will be sent to the UK to be opened by investigators. A full investigation into the crash is expected to take months.\nThere are some critical questions investigators need to answer.\nIf the plane did indeed run out of fuel, why didn't the crew fill up en route, as was reportedly planned?\nAnd why wasn't it carrying the required 30-minute fuel reserve? Or maybe it was, and there was a fuel leak somewhere.\nAlso, why was the aircraft told to circle while another flight with a problem was given priority to land? Did the crew make it clear to the ground that they had a crisis on their hands?\nLooking at the radar track, it appears to circle for around 13 minutes. Yet it was only around three or four minutes flying time from the airport.\nAccidents normally come down to a series of problems and decisions that add up to catastrophe. There are often moments, with hindsight, where a tragedy could have been averted.\nWe still don't have an official explanation yet. So, there may be facts or problems yet to come out that put a totally different complexion on what happened.\nOn Wednesday night, when the match had been due to take place, tens of thousands of fans gathered at the Medellin stadium - and at Chapecoense's home ground in Chapeco - to pay tearful tributes.\nMany wore white and carried candles as a mark of respect. Chapecoense lost 19 players in the crash. Twenty journalists were also killed.\nOf the survivors, Chapecoense said that two players remained in a critical but stable condition, while the club's goalkeeper had had one leg amputated and might still lose his other foot.\nAn injured journalist also remained in critical condition, the club said. \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: The first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell - Dolly - died at the relatively young age of 6.5 years, having suffered from osteoarthritis.\nThis raised concerns that cloned animals might age more quickly.\nBut the new study, which tracked four sheep cloned from the same ewe as Dolly, found they had aged normally.\nSome of the animals did show mild - and in one case moderate - signs of osteoarthritis. But the researchers say that it was not sufficiently severe that any of the animals required treatment.\nAre cloned animals born old?\nWhen she was born on 5 July 1996, Dolly was the first animal to be cloned from an adult cell using a technique known as somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT).\nWriting in Nature Communications, a team led by Prof Kevin Sinclair at Nottingham University reports that the sheep Debbie, Denise, Dianna and Daisy reached their eighth birthdays in good health.\nThe Nottingham team based their conclusions on examination of Dolly's four \"sisters\" and nine other cloned sheep - all between seven and nine years of age.\n\"Healthy ageing of SCNT clones has never been properly investigated,\" said Prof Sinclair.\n\"Following our detailed assessments of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, blood pressure and musculoskeletal investigations we found that our clones, considering their age, were at the time of our research healthy.\"\nThe researchers performed  a battery of tests, including assessments of the animals' bones, joints and muscles, along with blood pressure measurements. They then compared these to \"control\" sheep aged between five and six years old.\nThey found no major health issues: there was no sign of metabolic disease, such as diabetes, in the clones and their blood pressure was normal.\nThe evidence of mild osteoarthritis in the clones - and a moderate case of the disease in Debbie - could be a normal feature of sheep as they age, the researchers write in their scientific paper.\nDolly's birth was a sensation when first announced to the world, and the technique that produced her was heralded as a way to develop new medical therapies or to save endangered species. But cloning is very inefficient. And even after 20 years of additional investigation, too many experiments yield no viable clone.\nProf Sinclair said the latest study offered a route to better understand why this was so, but conceded that SCNT still had a way to go to fulfil its promise.\nHe told BBC News: \"And so there still remains an ethical and welfare concern with cloning and what we have to do is reduce the incidence of these losses to levels that approach those of natural conception before I think the technique would be widely accepted by the general public.\"\nWhen the Nottingham study was conducted last year, Dolly's sisters were aged eight. They have recently turned nine, which roughly corresponds to an age of 60-70 in human years.\nThe scientists will further assess the osteoarthritis question when the sheep die and post-mortem examinations can be carried out.\nThe effort to clone Dolly was led at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh by Prof Sir Ian Wilmut, who later abandoned research on SCNT.\nThe late Prof Keith Campbell was instrumental in this pioneering work. In 1999, he joined the University of Nottingham where he continued his research in reproductive biology until his death in 2012.\nThe flock of cloned sheep is his legacy to the university. \n",

Kate Bush, barefoot and in black, sang into a microphone with a seven-piece band behind her. After her second song, Hounds of Love, she declared \"I need a drink of water\" and swigged from a bottle at the side of the stage.\nThis could have been any gig almost anywhere. Perhaps Bush had decided to abandon the lavish theatricals of her one and only tour 35 years earlier in favour of something more conventional.\nBut then, six songs in, everything changed.\nA dancer leapt centre stage, manically spinning an object around his head. Confetti exploded into the auditorium, and a giant screen dropped in front of the stage and played a short film featuring an astronomer.\nHere, at last, was the much-anticipated live performance of The Ninth Wave, Kate Bush's 30-minute sonic odyssey about a shipwreck from 1985's Hounds of Love album.\nWhat followed were surely some of the most mind-bending images ever to find their way into a rock concert - huge billowing sheets making a seascape, a search-and-rescue helicopter buzzing over the audience and sailors in lifejackets brandishing hatchets and a chainsaw.\nThere was even a bizarre mini-play - with Bush's teenage son Bertie as one of the characters - about cooking sausages.\nAnd in the midst of it all Bush herself was carried off by what can only be described as fish skeleton creatures. This was the stuff of nightmares.\nEven lovers of Kate Bush's music - and the Hammersmith Apollo was packed with them - were not expecting something so off the chart.\nIt felt like an opera, am-dram, a movie and a West End musical rolled into one.\nAfter a 20-minute interval, Bush was back with more stunning visuals to accompany a batch of songs - collectively known as The Sky of Honey - from the 2005 album Aerial.\nA wooden puppet child wandered the stage as Bush sang at her piano. Giant projections of birds in flight filled the back of the stage while 16-year-old Bertie was back in the role of an artist at work on a huge canvas.  He even got to sing a solo song, Tawny Moon.\nThe early songs from the late 1970s and early 1980s that made a Bush a household name were absent, but no-one seemed to mind.\nBush may not be the energetic 20-year-old who last performed on the same stage in 1979, but the 56-year-old singer has retained the power to entrance her audience. Among the cheers, some were moved to tears at this most unpredictable of comebacks.\nAfter the three-hour show, thousands spilled out into a damp London night knowing they had witnessed something unique. It's likely that many will wake next morning feeling they have been not only to a gig, but squeezed in a trip to the cinema and the theatre as well. \n",

He deserves it.\"\nEngland face a significant run chase against Pakistan, with the visitors finishing day three on 214-8 with a lead of 281.\nWoakes had a disappointing tour of South Africa at the turn of the year, picking just two wickets in as many games. However, he improved to gather eight wickets in two Tests against Sri Lanka more recently.\n\"He's come back a bit stronger,\" said Vaughan, who expects Woakes to be in the side even when Jimmy Anderson and Ben Stokes return from injury for the second Test at Old Trafford.\n\"I think he puts more energy into the action, power into the ball. And that's why he's bowling quicker.\n\"I'm sure the coaches have helped, but he's done it himself. he's worked it out and come back a fantastic cricketer.\"\nWoakes' efforts with the ball were complemented by his batting, notably when he tackled Pakistan's leg-spinning star Yasir Shah.\nFive England batsmen fell to Yasir on Friday, but Woakes faced 51 of his deliveries to score 17 of his 35 runs.\nFormer England opener Geoffrey Boycott said: \"He had confidence. It's not about runs all the time, but about the way he played him. He was comfortable. The other batsmen were like a cat on a hot tin roof. They were fidgety all the time.\n\"He wasn't hurried and wasn't frightened of the leg-spinner. He's made himself a really good cricketer now.\"\nVaughan too was impressed with the demeanour of Woakes, especially with bat in hand, adding: \"You can see he puts his chest out, his shoulders are back and he says to the bowlers: 'Yeah, I belong at Test level.'\"\n\"It's my ninth test. I probably haven't shown people what I can do on this arena so far. It's nice to have a really good Test match. It's just my day that I managed to get the wickets.\n\"The guys have already stuck the tape on the Lord's honours board for it to be engraved [for taking 10 wickets in a Test]. There are some amazing names on that board - the legends of the game.\n\"The 10th was in the back of my mind particularly when I got my third wicket in this innings. To get that 10th and get on the board, it was a lovely moment. When you take that 10th, it is hard to explain, but I suppose the celebrations tell a story as well.\"\nMike Ball: Woakes is going to be a more important all-rounder to England than Stokes, but what a team we'll have with them both playing.\nDavid Beckett: Woakes is exceptional. Stokes and Anderson should come in for Finn and Ball. Maybe even Rashid for Moeen.\nThomas Measures: Starting to worry less about Anderson retiring with every games Woakes plays. Just getting better and better.\nLittle villain: Does anyone else think Woakes is bowling like Anderson? The similarities are spooky. \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe man with one of the biggest egos in world football was celebrating a record-breaking 128th cap for Portugal, surpassing Luis Figo's tally.\nBut the Euro 2016 match against Austria, which finished 0-0, turned out to be one he will want to forget. Quickly.\n\"This was one of the greatest goalscorers we have seen having an absolute nightmare,\" said former England captain Alan Shearer.\nRonaldo, 31, looked happy and relaxed as the match got under way. About 20,000 fans from his homeland were banking on him to score and help Portugal towards a place in the last 16.\nHe looked certain to do just that with a close-range sidefooted effort in the first half but staggeringly steered the ball wide. It was the first of 10 efforts in the game - all unsuccessful.\nThe Real Madrid forward spent the rest of the first half drifting across Portugal's front line, looking for support from former Manchester United colleague Nani, but struggled to make a real impact.\nBy the time Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli blew for half-time, Ronaldo looked so deflated it took him a good minute longer than any other player to trudge off down the tunnel.\nMaybe the second half would bring Ronaldo better luck? Maybe not.\nThere were a couple of mishit free-kicks (taking his tally to 36 direct free-kicks attempted at major tournaments, no goals), the occasional flick and feint, and time and again he implored team-mates to spread the ball wide and send it into the penalty box for him to utilise his heading prowess.\nJust when it seemed the script appeared to have taken a twist in his favour as Martin Hinteregger wrestled him to the ground for a penalty, the worst was to come.\nThe man who sealed the shootout win for Real Madrid against against city rivals Atletico in the Champions League final a few weeks ago could not deliver from the penalty spot.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThere were gasps of disbelief from 20,000 Portuguese fans, who had never before seen one of their players miss a spot-kick outside of a shootout at a major tournament. There were almost as many howls of delight from Austria's fans as he sent his effort against the post. It was his fourth missed penalty in his past five attempts for club and country.\n\"He created a lot of chances and normally he would have scored a hat-trick,\" said Match of the Day pundit Thierry Henry. \"When he was about to take the penalty I didn't fancy him - sometimes you can see when a player is not at it and he wasn't tonight.\"\nEven then, there was another cruel twist when he finally found the net with a superb glancing header but was thwarted by the offside flag - cue more histrionics.\nThat effort took his tally of shots in the tournament to 20 - 11 more than any other player and more than nine other teams.\n\"We did everything right but the ball did not go in, once again,\" said another former Manchester United winger, Nani.\n\"What can we say? We cannot excuse ourselves with 'the ball won't go in' - we had chances.\"\nThe only victory of sorts came at the very end, when the match had finished. A fan sprinted on to the pitch and Ronaldo seemed more than happy to pose for a selfie.\nThe stewards had tried to stop the invader and Ronaldo was arguably reckless and irresponsible - or very accommodating - despite his miserable evening.\n\"His performance showed he's human,\" said Ronaldo's former Manchester United team-mate Rio Ferdinand on Match of the Day.\n\"What he's been doing for 10 years has been relentless - achievement after achievement. He didn't get the rub of the green but he kept going and his head didn't drop.\"\nThe Ronaldo roadshow will roll on to a game against Hungary in Lyon on Wednesday, with Portugal's captain desperate to ensure he is not remembered for failing on the biggest of stages. \n",

It was left to the RSPCA, RSPB and Blue Cross charities.\nMrs Ilott later married her partner. They have five children and the court heard Mrs Ilott planned to use the inheritance to buy their housing association home.\nby Clive Coleman, legal affairs correspondent\nWhen Melita Jackson died in 2004 she made it crystal clear she didn't want her estranged daughter Heather Ilott to benefit, and so left her estate to animal charities with which she had little connection.\nThe relationship between mother and daughter soured when, aged 17, Heather eloped with her future husband.\nYesterday she was awarded a third of the estate because her mother hadn't left \"reasonable provision\" for her in the will.\nShe'll now be able to buy her housing association property and won't lose her state benefits.\nExperts say the ruling means you can still disinherit your children but you'll have to explain why and what connects you to those you do leave money to.\nThat'll make it easier for adult \"disinherited\" children to challenge wills and claim greater sums by way of reasonable provision.\nMrs Jackson made her last will in 2002 with a letter to explain why she had disinherited her only daughter, referring to the fact she had walked out of her home in 1978 to live with her boyfriend.\nMrs Ilott, who was an only child born two months after her father died in an accident, had in 2007 won the right to an inheritance of \u00a350,000 after a district judge concluded she had been \"unreasonably\" excluded by Mrs Jackson. That ruling was reversed, before Appeal Court judges ruled she was entitled to a share of the money.\nCase timeline\n2002: Melita Jackson makes her last will with a letter to explain why she had disinherited her only daughter, referring to the fact that she had walked out of her home in 1978 to live with her boyfriend.\n2004: Mrs Jackson dies aged 70.\n2007: Heather Ilott, her daughter, challenges the will under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act and is awarded \u00a350,000 on the basis she had been \"unreasonably\" excluded by her mother. But when she applies for a larger share of the money, a High Court judge reverses the decision to award it to her in the first place.\n2011: The Court of Appeal rules Mrs Ilott is entitled to a share of the money after all.\n2014: Mrs Ilott loses a battle to get a larger share of the money at the High Court - a decision which has now been successfully challenged at the Court of Appeal.\nWhen Mrs Ilott appealed to get the amount increased, Mrs Justice Parker dismissed this at the High Court in London, ruling in March 2014 that the previous decision that \u00a350,000 was appropriate could not \"be said to be wrong\".\nHowever, in the latest hearing Lady Justice Arden said Mrs Ilott's mother had been \"unreasonable, capricious and harsh\" and ruled she should receive a greater proportion of the estate.\nIn a joint statement, the three charities said they were \"surprised and disappointed\" by the judgement.\nThe solicitor representing them, James Aspden from Wilsons LLP, said it was a \"worrying decision for anyone who values having the freedom to choose who will receive their property when they die\".\nDavid Mitson from Gisby Harrison Solicitors, who made Mrs Jackson's will, said he could not comment on the latest development because of client confidentiality.\nA battle of wills \n",

Also, their brains are longer top-to-bottom than front-to-back, meaning the force against the skull is spread over a larger brain area.\nA highly-developed bone called the hyoid - which in humans is just above the \"Adam's apple\" - has also been studied: starting at the underside of the birds' beaks, it makes a full loop through their nostrils, under and around the back of their skulls, over the top and meeting again before the forehead.\nHowever, Ming Zhang of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, a co-author of the new work, said that he and his colleagues wanted to get to the bottom of the problem numerically.\n\"We thought that most of the previous studies were limited to the qualitative answer to this question,\" he told BBC News.\n\"More quantitative studies are necessary to answer this interesting problem, which would aid in applying the bio-mechanism to human protective device design and even to some industry design.\"\nFirst, the team had a look at woodpeckers in a controlled environment: two slow-motion cameras captured images of the birds striking a force sensor that measured their pecking power.\nThey found that the birds slightly turn their heads as they peck, which influences how forces are transmitted.\nThe team also gathered computed tomography and scanning electron microscope analyses of woodpecker skulls, laying out in detail how the parts fit together and where bone density varied.\nWith those data in hand, they were able to use a computer simulation to calculate the forces throughout the birds' skulls in the process of pecking.\nThe team's simulations showed that three factors were at work in sparing the birds injury.\nFirstly, the hyoid bone's looping structure around the whole skull was found to act as a \"safety belt\", especially after the initial impact.\nThe team also found that the upper and lower halves of the birds' beaks were uneven, and as force was transmitted from the tip of the beak into the bone, this asymmetry lowered the load that made it as far as the brain.\nLastly, plate-like bones with a \"spongy\" structure at different points in the skull helped distribute the incoming force, thereby protecting the brain.\nThe team stresses that it is the combination of the three, rather than any one feature, that keeps woodpeckers pecking without injury. \n",

The days of mainstream media are gone, to a certain extent - there are quite a few rising media start-ups, there's quite a lot of competition and more unorthodox thinking.\n\"We're trying to give the public what they want - there's a palpable interest on the part of audiences to get other angles and context for them to make up their minds.\"\nWest Dunbartonshire MP Martin Docherty said he would \"urge caution seasoned with a heavy dose of cynicism\" regarding state-sponsored broadcasters \"that are never reflective of the reality of life in their own nations\", particularly with regard to human rights.\nHe said: \"Difficult as it may be for some, the reality in Russia today is the potential prison sentence that awaits anyone expressing a belief in independence from the Russian Federation and that you won't see much of an examination into how Russia's LGBTI community is treated on a daily basis.\n\"I remain to be convinced that Sputnik will ever be a tool for dialogue, it seems more are a tool for disinformation.\"\nDr Aman Cheskin, a specialist in East European Studies at Glasgow University, said Sputnik was a \"state-sponsored initiative\" to \"support a clear Kremlin line\".\nHe said: \"It's all part of the general Kremlin message, the 'information war' some people call it.

It was was also within 500m (1,640ft) of homes, flouting laws which state a 1km minimum distance.\nLocal media had earlier reported that there were at least three residential complexes within 1km of the warehouse, which belonged to Ruihai International Logistics.\nIn the latest in a number of small protests, the people gathered at the Mayfair Hotel on Monday said they wanted compensation for their damaged homes, and would refuse to return to them even if they were ruled safe.\n\"We don't know if there will be further leaks in the future. We could be living near a ticking time bomb,\" one resident, who gave his name as Chen, told reporters.\nIn an open letter to the authorities, the residents said their groundwater could have been contaminated, and that logistics companies and chemical \"dumping grounds\" remained close to residential complexes.\n\"Our neighbours lost their lives there. Their screams can never be erased for a long time. How can we live in that 'execution ground' with any peace of mind?\" the letter states.\nThe chemical sodium cyanide is white crystalline or granular powder which can be rapidly fatal if inhaled or ingested, as it interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen.\nIt is mostly used in chemical manufacturing, for fumigation and in the mining industry to extract gold and silver.\nIt is soluble in water, and absorbs water from air. Its dust is also easy to inhale.

Despite the connection, the spokesman said Lizard Squad did not play a \"large part\" in the attacks the GoP mounted against Sony.\nGoP's attacks involved exposing confidential information about many Sony employees and sharing thousands of emails sent between employees, film stars and movie makers.\nThe Lizard Squad member said his group \"handed over some Sony employee logins\" that were used by GoP to get its initial attack underway. The admission is the first acknowledgement by the Lizard Squad of its connection to GoP.\nThe information throws some doubt on the theory that North Korea was behind the attacks on Sony's internal systems. The state was accused of being behind the hack by the FBI because The Interview is about a fictional American plot to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and Pyongyang has filed formal complaints about the film.\nHowever, the Reuters news agency has reported that US investigators are exploring whether North Korea \"contracted out\" some of the work involved, which could explain how Lizard Squad formed links to GoP.\nLizard Squad members are all based in European nations, said the senior member.\nThe GoP attacks forced Sony to withdraw the film from its planned release, but it is now available to view online and is on show at some cinemas. It made about $15m (\u00c2\u00a39.6m) through downloads alone over its first three days of distribution.\nThe Lizard Squad spokesperson did not elaborate on how the group got hold of the login information for Sony employees. However, it is possible it found or uncovered them while searching for ways to attack the PlayStation gaming network.\nThe Lizard Squad has repeatedly attacked Sony's network and many others during 2014. On Christmas Day it managed to disrupt it and the Xbox Live network for hours leaving many gamers unable to log in.\nThe spokesperson said the attacks were carried out to expose the \"massive security issues\" many large companies suffer.\n\"The customers of these companies should be rather worried,\" they said.\nThe attacks on the PlayStation and Xbox networks have now stopped thanks to the intervention of tech entrepreneur Kim Dotcom. Instead, the group has switched its attention to the Tor network which has taken steps to limit the effect the Lizard Squad can have on the system. \n",

The researchers then used a computer algorithm that scored words according to how closely they are related in terms of meaning.\nThe results were converted into a thesaurus-like map where the words were arranged on the left and right hemispheres of the brain.\nThey show that the semantic system is distributed broadly in more than 100 distinct areas across both halves - hemispheres - of the cortex and in intricate patterns that were consistent across individuals in the study.\nThe maps show that many areas of the human brain represent language describing people and social relations rather than abstract concepts.\nBut the same word could be repeated several times on different parts of the brain map. For example, the word \"top\" was represented in a part of the brain that responds to words about clothing and appearance, and also in a region that deals with numbers and measurements.\n\"Our semantic models are good at predicting responses to language in several big swaths of cortex,\" said Dr Huth.\n\"But we also get the fine-grained information that tells us what kind of information is represented in each brain area. That's why these maps are so exciting and hold so much potential.\"\nScientists could track the brain activity of patients who have difficulty communicating and then match that data to language maps to determine what their patients are trying to express.\n\"Although the maps are broadly consistent across individuals, there are also substantial individual differences,\" said the study's senior author Jack Gallant.\n\"We will need to conduct further studies across a larger, more diverse sample of people before we will be able to map these individual differences in detail.\" \n",

He started working with Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings in 2013.\nGerman prosecutors said on Monday that Lubitz had received treatment for \"suicidal tendencies\" before completing his training.\nBut Lufthansa said his medical records were subject to doctor-patient confidentiality and it had no knowledge of their contents.\nThe company has set aside an additional $300m (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac280m; \u00c2\u00a3200m) to cover possible costs arising from the crash.\nThe money is separate from the $54,250 available to the relatives of each passenger to cover short-term expenses.\nAirlines are obliged to compensate relatives for proven damages of up to a limit of about $157,000, regardless of what caused the crash. Higher compensation is possible if an airline is held liable.\nNone of the victims' bodies were found intact after the plane's 700kph (430mph) impact, but different strands of DNA have been identified.\nFrench President Francois Hollande said on Tuesday that all 150 victims would be identified by the end of the week.\nSpeaking at a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Mr Hollande said \"exceptional scientific work\" had been carried out by the recovery team.\nAndreas Lubitz: Germanwings co-pilot\nWho was Andreas Lubitz? \n",

It is a key ally of the US and, together with Egypt, one of only two Arab nations to have made peace with Israel.\nThe desert kingdom emerged out of the post-World War I division of the Middle East by Britain and France.\nThe population at that time was largely made up of tribes which had taken part in the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire.\nToday, those original inhabitants - known as East Bank Jordanians - are outnumbered by the descendants of Palestinian refugees from Israel and the West Bank.\nCountry profiles by BBC Monitoring\nThe first ruler of Jordan, the Hashemite Abdullah I, was born in Mecca and played a leading role in the Great Arab Revolt.\nThe death in February 1999 of King Hussein, who ruled for 46 years, left Jordan still struggling for economic and social survival, as well as regional peace.\nHis son, Abdullah II faces the task of maintaining stability while accommodating calls for reform. A blueprint for long-term political, economic and social change - known as the National Agenda - has yet to be implemented, and the Arab Spring popular revolts across the region found some resonance in street protests.\nJordan's reputation as one of the region's safest countries was dealt a blow in late 2005 when dozens of people were killed in suicide bomb attacks on hotels in the capital. Iraq-based Islamic militants claimed responsibility. The king said Jordan had been targeted because of its location and its stances.\nThe civil war in neighbouring Syria has seen Jordan play host to some 600,000 Syrian refugees, while the resurgence of Islamic militancy in Iraq also presents security challenges for Amman.\nUnlike Arab states to the south and east, Jordan has no oil of its own. Its resources are limited to phosphates and agricultural produce. The economy depends largely on services, tourism and foreign aid, of which the US is the main provider. Jordan prides itself on its health service, one of the best in the region.\nJordan engaged in two conflicts abroad in 2014 and 2015, taking part in air strikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Houthi rebels in Yemen. \n",

With an eight-shot lead going into the final round, McIlroy showed few signs of nerves and stretched his lead to 10 shots with two birdies in the opening four holes.\nHe made only his second bogey of the week after driving into sand on the 12th, but kept up the momentum with a number of crucial putts on the back nine.\nHis first three-putt of the week at the 17th saw him drop a shot but he held his nerve for par at the last to banish his Augusta demons and win his first major title by eight strokes - the fourth highest winning margin in US Open history.\nThe victory has led to McIlroy being made odds-on favourite with bookmakers to win BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2011.\nAndy Murray, who is set to play at Wimbledon this week, is among the other leading contenders for the accolade, while other major sport events to come this year include the Rugby World Cup, which starts 9 September in New Zealand.\nArriving at his press conference, McIlroy took a photo of the US Open trophy and posted it on Twitter with two words: 'Winning' and 'bounceback.'\n\"I felt like I got over the Masters pretty quickly,\" added the second youngest European major winner of all time - and the youngest since 1872.\n\"I kept telling you guys that and I don't know if you believed me or not.

Nice to prove some people wrong.\"\nNow, McIlroy is eyeing up a duel with former world number one and 14-time major winner Tiger Woods, who missed his first US Open in 16 years due to leg injuries.\n\"When I was growing up, I always had putts to beat Tiger Woods in the Masters or US Open,\" added the man from Holywood, Northern Ireland.\n\"So it would be great to be able to get in contention one day...and go down the stretch with him because I've never really had that experience before.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron was among those to pay tribute to McIlroy.\n\"Congratulations to Rory McIlroy on a tremendous win at the US Open and his first major title,\" he said.\n\"At just 22, the youngest US Open Champion for 88 years, he has already shown himself to be at the top of his sport.\n\"He's an incredible talent and clearly has a very exciting career ahead of him.\"\nOn Monday, McIlroy's countryman Darren Clarke withdrew from this week's European Tour event in Munich because he wants to be in Northern Ireland for the world number four's homecoming party.\nThe 42-year-old, who did not qualify for the US Open, will compete at next month's Open at Sandwich through his 30th place on last year's money list. \n",

The system was based on number plates so a licence ending in a five or six meant the car couldn't be driven on Monday and so on.\nThe programme, known as Hoy No Circula, has been hugely successful in terms of compliance and has seen some improvements in air quality with Mexico no longer ranked as the most polluted city, having been overtaken on that dubious honour list by the likes of Beijing and Delhi.\nMexico's driving curbs were extended to Saturdays back in 2008 with an analysis carried out beforehand indicating that nitrogen oxides and large particulates would decline by 16%.\nTo look at the impact of the Saturday restriction, US researchers analysed not just air quality samples but also public transportation numbers and weekend attendance at the city's zoo to get a clearer picture of overall activity.\n\"I looked at a whole bunch of pollutants, mean levels, maximum levels, every hour of the day, but I couldn't find any evidence that the programme improved air quality,\" Dr Lucas Davis from the University of California, Berkeley, who carried out the study told BBC News.\n\"The thinking was it was supposed to get people to take public transportation but if you look at data, they didn't and anecdotally people say they don't take the subway on the day they can't drive, they get a family member to drive them or they take taxis.\"\nPublic transport in Mexico City is inexpensive the author says, but often overcrowded. He also believes there are cultural factors behind the reluctance to give up the car.\n\"Driving is a real status symbol in Mexico City, and once a family have raised enough money to buy a car, there's a status associated with private vehicles that's tough for people to break. There's a bit of a cultural or socio-economic resistance to taking public transport.\"\nDespite this study, other experts believe that Mexico has made significant strides towards improving the environment while both the population and the economy have expanded and hundreds of thousands of new vehicles have come on to the roads.\n\"Alongside driving restrictions, Mexico City has made massive investments in public transport to provide cleaner alternatives to driving,\" said Mark Watts, executive director of C40, the global network of cities dedicated to improving the environment and fighting climate change.\n\"Several new bus rapid transit lines have opened recently and they have the largest year-round bike sharing scheme in North America. At the recent C40 Mayors Summit hosted by Mexico City, Mayor Mancera committed to ban diesel cars from the city by 2025, because they are responsible for the pollutants that are most dangerous to public health.\"\nMadrid, Athens and Paris have have also promised to stop the use of all diesel powered cars and trucks from the middle of the next decade.\nMany cities in emerging economies are now putting driving restrictions similar to Mexico in place to curb the growing problem of dirty air.  So are there lessons in the Mexican experience that will make the imposition of driving schemes more effective in other growing cities?\n\"You have to go more directly after pollution,\" says Dr Davis.\n\"So that means increasing the cost of driving, and that means higher gas prices, or congestion pricing or parking and it also means more emissions testing and making it more stringent.\"\nThe research has been published in the journal, Scientific Reports.\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook \n",

The highlight of the evening is the president's speech, during which he makes fun of himself, his allies and his opponents, often in equal measure.\nMr Obama has not spared many from his zingers in past years - and that includes current Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump.\nHe's also returned to a few common threads throughout his presidency: jokes about his \"birth country\" (Kenya, as some critics falsely claim), and the challenges of facing a hostile Republican Congress.\nHere's a look at some of Mr Obama's best lines and sharpest jabs from the past seven White House Correspondents Dinners, and the political context in which they were delivered.\n\"Welcome to the fourth quarter of my presidency,\" Mr Obama said in 2015, noting his wife, Michelle, was cheering the loudest.\nMr Obama spent a good portion of the speech picking on conservatives and their efforts to block him in the last two years of his presidency.\n\"[Former Republican representative] Michele Bachmann predicted I'd bring about a Biblical end-of-days,\" Mr Obama said, shaking his head. \"Now that's a legacy.\"\nAs races in Congress heated up in spring 2014, Mr Obama made reference to his sinking poll numbers and Democrats worrying about a negative effect on their own elections.\n\"Sasha needed a speaker at Career Day and she asked Bill Clinton,\" Mr Obama said of his youngest daughter.  \"I was a little hurt.\"\nHe also made the first reference to a likely presidential run by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nIn the middle of a problematic roll out for the website for Mr Obama's healthcare law, Mr Obama needled himself about \"rookie mistakes\" - including commenting on California Attorney General Kamala Harris's looks.\nMr Obama also mocked some media companies, saying \"BuzzFeed\" used to be \"something I did in college at 2am\" and comparing his recent horrendous free throw session (two out of 22) as less reliable than broadcaster NBC's record with successful programmes.\nWhile the Republican candidates for the presidency in 2012 were still battling in the primaries, Mr Obama singled out front-runner (and eventual nominee) Mitt Romney to compare educations. Two degrees from Harvard instead of one? \"Snob\" Mr Obama joked.\nThe president also opened his 2012 speech with a nod to the year before.\n\"In fact this very weekend last year, we finally delivered justice to one of the world's most notorious individuals.\"\nMr Obama had announced the death of Osama bin Laden the day after the 2011 Correspondents Dinner. But the picture on the screen behind him in 2012? Donald Trump.\nAfter Donald Trump pressed Mr Obama for his long-form birth certificate (three years after Mr Obama had been elected), Mr Obama did so, and then took it to Mr Trump at the 2011 dinner.\nThe businessman was in the audience - and he wasn't laughing.\nIn year two of Mr Obama's administration, he noted his approval ratings were dropping from highs right after his election, but was still using material that referred back to the 2008 campaign.\nThe president also made reference to struggling banks and the US attempt to shore them up after a market crash. \"All our jokes tonight are brought to you by Goldman Sachs,\" He said. \"They make money whether you laugh or not.\"\nMr Obama's first correspondents dinner came shortly after he had finished his first 100 days in office - a milestone which many campaigns use to fulfil promises.\nHe took the opportunity to remind people what the new Obama administration had already done - and make light of an expensive situation for the US  - the government bailout of General Motors, a major automotive firm.\n\"Just last week, Car and Driver named me auto executive of the year,\" Mr Obama said. \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: The claim: A million people used food banks last year - up from 40,000 in 2010.\nReality Check verdict: More than a million food packages were handed out last year by the Trussell Trust, to a little over half a million people. This is significantly higher than in 2010. We don't know how much of this increase is down to an increase in demand and how much is because of new food banks opening in areas where people were already in need.\nBut that's not quite right. There were more than a million emergency food packages handed out in the last financial year. However, as we've pointed out before, this doesn't mean a million people accessed a food bank.\nThe main provider of food banks across the UK, the Trussell Trust, said it handed out 1.1 million emergency three-day food supplies in 2015-16, 2% more than in the previous financial year.\nThe network of food banks counts the number of vouchers it collects and one person can receive more than one voucher in the course of a year.\nThe charity says the average person using its food banks needs two vouchers a year. Based on this, we can estimate that there were a little over half a million unique users last year.\nFor comparison, 40,898 food packages were handed out in the financial year 2009-10, which seems to be the 40,000 figure to which Mr Corbyn refers.\nIn his question, Mr Corbyn also said: \"This week, an Oxford University study found that there is a direct link between rising levels of benefit sanctions and rising demand for food banks.\"\nThe report found the Trussell Trust's network of food banks experienced a spike in numbers after 2013, when more than one million sanctions were applied following changes to the administration of Jobseeker's Allowance. Between the financial years 2013-14 and 2014-15, foodbank use rose by 19%.\nResearchers found that, on average, for every 10 additional sanctions applied in each quarter of the year, five more adults would be referred to food banks in the area. As sanctioning decreased, food bank use also decreased.\nThere are no official government figures on food bank use. In 2013 the then Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, David Heath, said: \"The government does not believe it is possible to keep a record of the number of food banks, nor the potential number of people using them or other types of food aid, without placing unnecessary burdens on volunteers trying to help their communities.\"\nWhile the Trussell Trust runs the country's largest network of food banks and is our best source of data, more people may access food donations on an informal level through other charities, churches and drop-in centres.\nThis means we can't be sure exactly how many people rely on food aid.\nThere has also been a sharp rise in the number of food banks operating since 2010, so we can't necessarily tell whether all of the rise in food bank use is down to growing demand - some of it might be existing demand that previously went unmet.\nTrussell Trust data shows the most common reason for people having to access food banks was benefits delays (which includes sanctions) in 28% of cases, followed by low income (23%) and benefits changes (14%).\nWe know this because people using food banks run by the Trussell Trust have to be referred by a professional such as a doctor, social worker or Jobcentre worker, and these professionals have to tick a box stating the reason this service is needed.\nThe prevalence of people accessing food banks after benefit delays chimes with the University of Oxford's research.\nResearcher Dr Rachel Loopstra said: \"These findings show clear evidence of sanctions being linked to economic hardship and hunger.\"\nBecoming unemployed, homeless, sick or experiencing domestic abuse were other common reasons for people accessing food banks. Others used the services during children's school holidays to cover the period when they would not be receiving free school meals. \n",

On the law of averages, I don't think anybody can.\"\n\"It's all just a little bit of history repeating\" - Dame Shirley Bassey's famous words have never been more appropriate than for Coventry City's League One match against Peterborough United on Saturday.\nLast year's game at the Ricoh Arena between the sides saw the Sky Blues come from two goals down at half-time to win 3-2, and would you know it, it happened again on Saturday.\nJermaine Anderson and Erhun Oztumer put Posh ahead, but Romain Vincelot and an Adam Armstrong double gave the hosts victory.\n\"The second half: what can you say?,\" Sky Blues boss Tony Mowbray told BBC Coventry & Warwickshire. \"The supporters dragged the team along, we attacked with purpose, and Armstrong's second goal - if any player in the world scored that we would be eulogising that.\"\nHigh praise indeed, big Tone.\nAlmost a year ago to the day, Gary Rowett took charge of an ailing Birmingham City side, 23rd in the Championship table.\nSince then, it has been quite a remarkable turnaround by the Blues and they had the chance to go second in the table, albeit temporarily, in Saturday's early game against West Midlands rivals Wolves.\nBut goals from Dave Edwards and Sheyi Ojo at St Andrew's ruined Rowett's party and saw Wolves head coach Kenny Jackett beat Blues for the first time in eight attempts.\nFormer Burton boss Rowett told BBC WM 95.6: \"We got into 40 crossing positions and hit the first man or stood it up for the goalkeeper to take every time.

As the crane fell, it swivelled towards the slipway. Its boom struck the skipper and pinned him to the bow ramp.\n\"The deckhand immediately shouted for help and ran to the skipper. One of the shore staff quickly boarded Carol Anne and assisted the deckhand to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Another member of staff telephoned the emergency services.\"\nThe reported states that on the advice of the ambulance service, over the telephone, the crane was lifted off the skipper using the telehandler.\nThe report goes on: \"Shortly afterwards, paramedics in a fast-response car and an air ambulance arrived. Efforts to resuscitate the skipper continued but he could not be revived.

Last month, its French rival LVMH reported record sales.\nHermes said sales of its leather goods and saddlery, which account for half of the group's sales, rose by 14%, aided by the success of the Constance, Halzan, Lindy, Birkin and Kelly bags.\nSilk and textile sales, which earlier in the year were affected by terror attacks in Europe and slowing sales in China, picked up towards the end of 2016. They ended the year 1% lower.\nPerfume sales rose by 9%, helped by the launch of new fragrances. However, watch sales slipped 3%, \"penalised by a still challenging market\" and a high comparison basis at year-end.\nHermes said it would continue with its long-term development strategy.\n\"In the medium term, despite growing economic, geopolitical and monetary uncertainties around the world, the group confirms an ambitious target of growth rate for revenue at constant exchange rates,\" it added.\nShares in Hermes slipped 2.45 euros to 426 euros, but have risen more than a third in the past 12 months. \n",

If the system detects suspicious behaviour, the driver is alerted automatically by a report to his or her smartphone.\"\nHowever, Tooru Futami, engineering director at electronics engineering development division at Nissan, told Forbes that the car was not yet able to self-drive down the street or park itself in any space.\nHe said the demo version could only self-park in an area equipped with sensors and restricted to other robotic cars to avoid the risk of collision.\nSeveral car manufacturers and other companies such as Google have recently demonstrated driverless vehicles and three US states - California, Nevada and Florida - even allow self-driving cars on their roads.\nBut one analyst told the BBC the mass use of such vehicles was still some way off.\n\"Self-driving cars is the way we're heading - it's the pinnacle of the convergence of a lot of technologies,\" said Paul Newton from IHS Automotive.\n\"You have ad hoc car-to-car networking which will alert cars of problems ahead, roadside transmissions to limit speed, controlled steering and braking - and all these technologies will eventually converge to a point where you can arrive at something that drives itself.\n\"But I think that market for driverless cars is limited at the moment in terms of consumer perception. People still have a fairly strong desire to control their car, and producing these vehicles is more showcasing what's possible than what's likely at the moment.\"\nHe added that it was more likely the driver would be able to actively operate the vehicle in some places, but once he or she got into a controlled urban environment, the vehicle would take over.\n\"You'll arrive in a town - and there will be a signal sent to your car not to exceed a maximum speed, and you won't be able to, and distance to the car in front will also be controlled,\" he said.\n\"But it's still a long way off.\" \n",

As a supporter for over 55 years, how could I?\"\nBernstein and King were stunned by the content and tone of Lerner's email - especially lifelong Villa fan King, given he has known the American since his takeover in 2006.\nDespite their dissatisfaction, it is likely Bernstein and King would have stayed at Villa until Lerner had fulfilled his aim of selling the club. But the hostile interaction created a rift that could not be repaired.\nKing, a former Governor of the Bank of England, added: \"It is no longer possible to carry out the role that I was asked to perform. When you [Hollis], David Bernstein and I were asked join the board, we were able to make a start. But progress has stalled.\"\nBernstein's resignation letter said: \"I was invited on to the board to oversee a much needed review of the football side of the club including all aspects of operations at Bodymoor Heath.\n\"Following this I was to lead the implementation of this review and the ongoing management of football at Aston Villa. To this end a football board was created consisting of four people with considerable football and relevant experience. For this new structure to work it required all at the club to accept new disciplines, clear reporting lines and to adhere to the authority delegated to the new football board.\n\"Unfortunately it has proved impossible to implement the agreed structure and my position has quickly become untenable. The issues at the club are fundamental and the solutions are radical and do not lend themselves to compromise.\"\nIt is understood that Bernstein and King came into Villa expecting a far greater level of authority and autonomy than they ultimately received.\nTheir initial communication with Lerner was positive, but that changed when they set about implementing their plans and it is not clear whether the owner was ever fully aware of the exact brief agreed between them and Hollis.\nThe newly formed football board - comprising Bernstein, King, former Villa player and manager Brian Little and ex-Football Association executive Adrian Bevington - never actually held a meeting or discussion as a group.\nLittle, who arrived on the same day as former FA and Manchester City chairman Bernstein, remains in his role as an advisor to the board.\nBevington is thought to be deliberating over whether to continue his work with the club, who were relegated from the Premier League with defeat at Manchester United last Saturday.\nBefore Bernstein and King left, they presented Hollis with a shortlist of candidates to succeed Remi Garde as manager following his sacking on 29 March.\nThat consisted of four names, as well as two back-up options.\nVilla say the managerial search \"remains a priority\", while Hollis is \"currently engaged in extensive negotiations in relation to the sale of the club\".\nHave you added the new Top Story alerts in the BBC Sport app?

But he said the banks were partly to blame for their losses.\n\"AIB and BoS have undoubtedly acted carelessly and imprudently by failing to make full inquiries before advancing the money,\" he told the court during sentencing.\n\"Indeed the latter bank was given clear and precise warnings by its lawyers about the risks of accepting assurances in a letter from an alleged co-conspirator, a Swiss lawyer.\n\"It almost beggars belief senior management chose to disregard that warning and rushed to complete the deal at all costs.\n\"It is apparent from the evidence both the defendants took full advantage of the prevailing banking culture in which corners are cut, and checks on them superficial and cursory,\" Judge Goymer concluded.\nThe losses to the two banks were dwarfed by the initial sums of money involved in the frauds.\nClaiming to operate as the Pacific Group, the two men used bogus documents over a period of five years to dupe Allied Irish Banks (AIB) into lending them \u00a3740m to buy a portfolio of 16 different commercial properties.\nThe properties and their purchase were real, but their value was inflated, letting the fraudsters siphon off \u00a360m for their own ends.\nThe bank only realised it had been defrauded when it learned that Kallakis had a previous conviction under a false name.\nIn a separate fraud, against the BoS, the two men persuaded it to agree a loan of 29m euros, supposedly to convert a former passenger ferry into a luxury super-yacht.\nAgain, forged documents were used and the boat in question, on which the loan was secured, was in fact leaking and contaminated with asbestos.\nBy the time this was discovered, only 5.7m euros of the loan had been handed over to the fraudsters. \n",

But after he steps down, my path as an actor may become clearer,\" Mr Xiao told the BBC.\nMr  Xiao had always dreamed of becoming a singer but after moving to Guangdong from Sichuan province over a decade ago, he worked as a security guard to make ends meet.\nThen in 2008, one of his co-workers told him he looked like President Obama. At that point Mr Xiao had no idea who President Obama was as he did not really follow politics or global affairs.\nBut he scented opportunity and started mimicking President Obama: his expressions, gestures and unique way of talking.\nIn a curious sense, their careers can be seen to mirror one another. So just as President Obama was elected and sworn into the White House, so Mr Xiao launched his new and unusual career.\nMr Xiao speaks very little English but this never stopped him. He even developed a habit of making up words that approximated to English sounds when \"giving speeches\" during his performances.\nBut his career only really took off last year.  His resemblance to the president attracted a lot of Chinese and international media interest, particularly during Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to the United States.\nMr Xiao has since then become immensely popular for marketing events and has landed several commercial and movie deals. He recently starred in a streaming comedy called \"'Obama' goes on blind dates\".\nBut, he says, this resemblance was not always helpful: \"While he was in power, the name Obama became relatively sensitive in China,\" be said.\nMr Xiao recalls his first appearance on television, in 2012, when he appeared on a talent show to showcase his singing ability. When the producers realised that people on set were talking about his resemblance to Mr Obama, they ordered that the sequence be filmed again, without mention of the president, such is the sensitivity.\nBut it has made him richer than he could have imagined when he started work as a security guard.\nThe Obama impersonator told the BBC that he earns at least 100,000 yuan ($14,700; \u00c2\u00a311,700) every month now since last year.\nThe United States and China have not always exhibited the most cordial of relations, but Mr Xiao is counting his blessings.\n\"The majority of Chinese people know President Obama. He has left an impression among people from all over the world\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 People will not be able to forget him so soon.\"\n\"He is the first black US president. Putting politics aside, people admire that.\"\nMr Xiao is now studying part-time at a drama school in Beijing.\nSo the search must now be on for China's Trump. \n",

But if and when an agreement is brokered, the chances are that it will be hard to make it stick.\nSaudis halt air campaign with goals unfulfilled\nThe president took refuge in the southern port city of Aden after the rebels took full control of the capital Sanaa and placed him under house arrest.\nSaudi diplomatic sources told BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen, who is in Jeddah, that the air strikes had resumed because the Houthis \"broke a promise\" in Taiz.\nThe Saudis and their coalition partners reserved the right to use air power again when they announced the end of \"Operation Decisive Storm\" on Tuesday.\nA new, more limited campaign, \"Operation Restoring Hope\", would focus on preventing the rebels from \"targeting civilians or changing realities on the ground\" and finding a political solution the conflict, spokesman Brig Gen Assiri said.\nThe Saudi diplomatic sources said an agreement was being finalised with the Houthis.\nIn an apparent gesture of goodwill on Wednesday, the Houthis released Defence Minister Mahmoud al-Subaih, the brother of President Hadi and a military commander, rebel and tribal sources said. The three men had been held for nearly a month.\nFormer President Saleh has also urged all sides to \"return to dialogue to solve and treat all the issues\".\nIran, which denies providing military assistance to the rebels, described the Saudi decision as a positive development and called for peace talks.\nBut Pro-Hadi militiamen in southern Yemen declared they would continue fighting the rebels until they had driven them out of the region. \n",

They [atheists] are deluding themselves.\"\nMr Grieve went on to say that there had been a rise in the \"assertiveness\" of some religious groups, which some people with \"softer religions\" had found \"disturbing\".\n\"I do think that the rise of religious fundamentalism is a major deterrent to people,\" he said.\n\"It is a big turn-off away from religion generally, and it's very damaging in that context.\"\nMr Duncan Smith said claims that Britain was not a Christian country were \"absurd\" and ignored \"both historical and constitutional reality\".\n\"It is arguably our Christian heritage, with its innate tolerance and inclusivity, that has ensured the freedom of all voices - religious or non-religious - to be heard and to be valued,\" he said.\nAsked about the controversy at an event in London, Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg said: \"I'm not a man of faith but I think it's stating the obvious that we are a country underpinned, informed, infused by Christian values, Christian heritage, Christian history, Christian culture, and Christian values.\n\"That is something that is obvious about our identity as a nation.\n\"We are also a very tolerant nation. In fact one of the great Christian values is tolerance and respect for other people, people of other faiths, other views. So I think our Christian heritage sits very comfortably alongside our plurality and our tolerance as a people.\"\nA group including academics, authors and philosophers responded in an open letter to the Telegraph in which they said Mr Cameron's description of Britain as a Christian country had \"negative consequences for politics and society\".\nThe group, which included author Philip Pullman, comedian Tim Minchin and philosopher AC Grayling, wrote: \"Repeated surveys, polls and studies show that most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities.\"\nThey added that claiming Britain was a religious society \"fosters alienation and division\".\nIn response to Mr Grieve and Mr Duncan Smith's comments, Andrew Copson, from the British Humanist Association, said: \"We'll leave it to other people to argue whether, in light of its pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon and Roman influences and post-Christian enlightenment influences, our law can be described as Christian.\"\nHe said the letter \"made it clear that we respect the right of people to their religious beliefs but that in a very diverse society like today's we need to build an inclusive national identity not a narrow one. To try and make this instead a war of words about religion as such is a distraction.\"\nThe 2011 census found 59% of people in England and Wales said they were Christians - down from 72% a decade earlier.\nIn Scotland the figure was 54% - down from 65% - while the percentage fell slightly to 83% in Northern Ireland. \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: But, in economic terms, that is effectively where the government is as it approaches the Autumn Statement at the end of the month.\nThe previous Chancellor, George Osborne, set the government three rules it would adhere to, an attempt to show a sceptical public that it was bearing down on the country's deficit (the amount a country spends on public services versus the amount a country earns via tax receipts) and being tough on the accumulation of debt (the overall amount a government owes).\nAll three have been broken or abandoned - the cap on welfare spending, the pledge to reduce debt as a proportion of national income and the promise to balance the books (so ending the deficit) by 2020.\nThe last target was dumped after the result of the referendum brought forward a raft of economic downgrades for the UK economy which - if they come to pass - will lead to a reduction in government income and make eliminating the deficit even more problematic without further tax rises and public sector cuts.\nThat is the unhelpfully cut-up pitch on which the present Chancellor, Philip Hammond, is playing ahead of his first major economic outing, the Autumn Statement in two weeks' time.\nToday's report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals the difficulties ahead.\nIt suggests that given the slowdown predicted in the economy the chancellor will be dealing with a public finances outlook \u00a325bn worse than predicted in the Budget last March.\nWith no changes in policy - and that's a major assumption given that Mr Hammond is (a) a new chancellor and (b) has already spoken of a \"fiscal reset\" - the IFS says tax revenues will be \u00a331bn lower.\nThat will be partially offset, the IFS says, by the \u00a36bn the government may regain by ending its contributions to the EU budget.\nBut, again, that is a pretty major assumption.\nMany government sources I have spoken to believe that in order to smooth the transition to a free trade deal with the EU (particularly if there is no agreement on freedom of movement) the government may need to maintain some budget payments.\nOf course, in public finance terms, it is not all one-way traffic on Brexit.\nThe Bank of England's decision to cut interest rates to 0.25% reduces the cost of servicing the government's debt.\nThe fall in the value of the pound (which pushes up import prices) also makes Britain's trade deficit smaller as it improves export performance.\nAnd the increase in dollar earnings and profits for global companies based in the UK will also be beneficial for the government's tax receipts.\nThese are all rather more marginal than the overall negative effect of the predicted slowdown in the economy.\nSome believe those gloomy predictions will prove too pessimistic - just as the predictions of a possible recession this year proved to be.\nAnd, if they are, all the estimates on the public finances will have to be redone, again.\nSuch is the pain and unpredictability of economic forecasting.\nThis close to the Autumn Statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility - the official economic watchdog - will be giving the Treasury weekly updates on its predictions for the future of the public finances.\nThe OBR is likely to downgrade its growth predictions for the UK economy - following in the footsteps of the Bank of England.\nThat means that government receipts will be forecast to be lower.\nThe government could respond by cutting spending further (unpalatable), raising taxes (unpalatable) or loosening the deficit reduction target (likely).\nIf economic growth does slow, Mr Hammond's room for manoeuvre to gain back some of those lost goals will be limited. \n",

They also have experience of winning a competition and that counts for a lot.\nConnacht's season has been a real fairytale and they probably deserve to be in the final given how they have performed all season but whether they can go that extra step I don't know, it might be just too much for them.\nTony McWhirter was talking to BBC Sport NI's Richard Petrie \n",

She says the crew was given permission by the jail authorities and the ministry of home affairs.\nActivist Kavita Krishnan wondered how Udwin was allowed access to convicts inside jail when authorities \"prevent most human rights campaigners in India from speaking to, let alone filming, prisoners\".\nThe hour-long film also includes extensive interviews of the victim's parents, families of the convicts and their lawyers, interspersed with reconstruction of the incident.\nMukesh Singh, who is facing the death penalty along with three others, expressed no remorse and blamed the victim for fighting back.\nTimes Now news channel promptly took the lead in whipping up a campaign against the film, which it has described as \"voyeuristic\" and against \"all norms of journalism\".\nSome media analysts believe this has more to do with the channel's rivalry with NDTV, which had the rights to broadcast the film.\nCritics of the film have variously accused it of glorifying the rapist by giving him a platform, encouraging copycat crimes, or prejudicing the appeals of the rapists and spurring demands to fast-track their executions.\nOthers have been outraged that Indian audiences have been \"exposed to the remarks of such a brutal man\" on prime-time news. Although, it has to be said, Indians are accustomed to some pretty shocking stuff on prime-time news.\nA Delhi court has blocked the film \"until further orders\" after police said Mukesh Singh's \"offensive and derogatory remarks\" were \"creating an atmosphere of fear and tension with the possibility of public outcry and law and order situation\".\nA cynical friend suggests most of this outcry and potential danger to the law and order situation is confined to the TV studios and social media.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh has promised an inquiry into how the prison authorities gave permission to the film-maker and said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the interview.\nSome say India has sadly become a country of bans - films, books, and in a recent case, even beef.\nIt is not clear though whether the film's ban was provoked by a touchy Indian government led by the image-conscious Prime Minister Narendra Modi or because the home ministry was embarrassed.\nMany believe that the ban on the film hurts India's reputation most.\nWhen Mr Modi is trying hard to spruce up India's global image as a favoured destination to invest and visit, such ham-fisted and impulsive reactions cannot really help.\n\"It is patronising to control what people see about their own country,\" an American artist said on my Twitter timeline.\n\"Nobody sensible is suggesting banning the film,\" says writer Salil Tripathi. \"That is wrong\".\nBut the more things change, the more they remain the same.\nSenior minister Venkaiah Naidu talks about a \"conspiracy to defame India\" and says the \"country will be harmed if Ms Udwin's documentary is broadcast outside India\".\nMany believe India's image will be harmed because India's government is not seen to be supportive of free speech, and not because of Mukesh Singh's odious remarks.\nWhy don't they let Indians watch the film and make up their minds about it? Why can't the state be less paternalistic? \n",

Children in the treatment arm of the trial are getting less malaria.\n\"We're pretty excited about this and it doesn't look like there is any kind of adverse effect, but the data is not done until it's done.\"\nIn the untreated villages, 16% of children did not develop malaria during this rainy season compared with 25% in those being treated.\nThe scientists estimate that 94 bouts of malaria have been prevented in the 325 children in the villages being treated.\nThe drug seems to kill both parasitic worms and mosquitoes in the same way - by attacking their nervous systems so they cannot control their muscles.\n\"It is like having a big turkey dinner - it just wants to sit down and not move which is not good for the mosquito so it dies,\" Dr Foy told the BBC.\nThe fact that ivermectin works on both mosquitoes and parasitic worms could be an opportunity to tackle both diseases.\nBut it also raises the spectre of the worms and mosquitoes becoming resistant to the drug if it was used more widely.\nDr Foy concluded: \"Resistance is certainly a concern, not only against worms, but also against the mosquitoes.\n\"There has never been an insecticide that mosquitoes haven't evolved resistance to, so we'd have to be careful about that.\"\nGlobal deaths from malaria have fallen by 60% since 2010, however, the success is being put under threat by the rise of artemisinin-resistant malaria in south-east Asia.\nThe president of the ASTMH, Christopher Plowe, said: \"We're at a critical moment in the fight against malaria where drug and insecticide resistance is threatening hard-won progress.\n\"It's important to actively develop new tools and strategies, including re-purposing old tools, to keep pushing down malaria.\"\nFollow James on Twitter. \n",

He denies that charges against him, which he says are politically motivated.\nThe complete surprise of Mikheil Saakashvili's appointment as Odessa governor has left a large number of political observers at a loss for explanation.\nPresident Petro Poroshenko's reasons will be come clearer with time, but at the moment, many are struggling to see the strategy behind naming a former leader of another country to run a provincial government.\nSaakashvili is a political outsider, with few ties to the Odessa region, and comes with a reputation for divisiveness and a high level of self-involvement.\nBut he is a also pro-Western, pro-reform and apparently very loyal to Mr Poroshenko \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which will come in handy if he takes on local corruption and vested interests, as Mr Poroshenko apparently wants.\nThe move could be a stroke of genius on Mr Poroshenko's part \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or a blunder of breathtaking magnitude. At the very least, it points to his lack of choices among home-grown candidates.\nPresident Poroshenko made the announcement at a televised event in Odessa, with Mr Saakashvili standing beside him.\n\"We are united by our love of Odessa and Ukraine,\" Mr Poroshenko said, adding that that the new governor would bring in discipline and carry out much needed reforms.\n\"In just one year, Oddessites should feel that their living standards are higher.\"\nThe Ukrainian president also said his decision was part of his drive to limit the political influence of the country's oligarchs.\nAlthough there has been so far no official reaction from Russia, Moscow has been highly critical of him after Georgia and Russia fought a brief war in 2008.\nUnlike Ukraine's eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, Odessa has not been hit by the fighting between government forces and pro-Russian rebels.\nHowever, tensions in the strategic port remain high after clashes between pro- and anti-government protesters on 2 May 2014 left more than 40 people dead.\nThe majority of those who died were pro-Russian activists who perished in a fire in a trade union building. Investigations into what caused the blaze are continuing.\nThe Ukrainian government, Western leaders and Nato all say there is clear evidence that Russia is helping the rebels in the east with heavy weapons and soldiers. Independent experts echo that accusation.\nMoscow denies it, insisting that any Russians serving with the rebels are volunteers.\nMore than 6,000 people have been killed in fighting in eastern Ukraine that began in April 2014 when rebels seized large parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

There is no hiding place.\nThe stakes for the president are always sky-high, in everything he does, but it is also true that the stakes for a journalist in this position are not insignificant.\nWe were given a one-minute warning for the president's arrival. Suddenly the door opened and there he was, smiling broadly, shaking hands firmly, greeting everyone warmly.\nI had been given plenty of advice about reading the presidential body language during the interview.\nThe challenge for the interviewer is clear: to ask as many searching questions as possible within the allocated time. That time can be fixed or less fixed. It often depends on how the interview is progressing.\nThe president fielded the questions with his brand of polite firmness, even when repeatedly challenged about the meaning of \"back of the queue\", the offence and anxiety this had caused in some quarters, and the potential impact on the wider special relationship (intelligence-sharing, for example) of a British departure from the EU.\nAt another point he rejected suggestions that Europe's migration crisis has been caused in part by America's reluctance to take assertive action in Syria.\nHe did allow himself a smile when talking about his wife's importance to his presidency (\"I am labour, she's management\"), and about the experience of being driven around Windsor by the 94 year-old Duke of Edinburgh (a \"smooth ride\").\nBut this was above all a serious exchange about some of the biggest challenges of the day.\nHe thanked every member of the broadcast team before leaving the room, and chatted with a few of us about his love of Shakespeare (his favourites are Hamlet and Lear). He then left for a meeting with Labour's Jeremy Corbyn.\nAnd a final thought: a president in his final year who can still enthuse a big crowd of young people - of all backgrounds - is an exceptional politician.\nWhatever your views on his politics, that judgement is very difficult to deny. \n",

Your summarization should be as concise as possible.\n\nHere is the news:\nContent: Saki Kumagai scored the winning penalty after Ayumi Kaihori had saved two out of three American three spot-kicks.\nAlex Morgan had opened the scoring with a low strike before Aya Miyama poked in the equaliser late in normal time.\nAbby Wambach headed USA ahead in extra-time but Homare Sawa ensured a thrilling finale with a spectacular flicked effort at the near post.\nThe US will be heartbroken and annoyed that they did not manage to secure a record third World Cup having dominated for long periods in the match. But Pia Sundhage's side will rue their profligacy in front of goal, particularly in the first half.\nWambach was the biggest threat in that period and went closest when she crashed a vicious strike against the crossbar following a typical bulldozing run into the area.\nLively winger Lauren Cheney also went close on three occasions. First, she fired just wide at the near post before looping a header over. She then diverted Megan Rapinoe's delightful cross fractions off-target.\nAtlanta Beat midfielder Carli Lloyd also should have done better when she smashed her shot over the bar from 14 yards after Shannon Boxx's ball into the area was cleared into her path.\nJapan, who had not beaten the USA in 25 meetings - losing 22 of those, looked to catch their opponents on the counter. That tactic paid dividends against hosts Germany in the quarter-final and semi-final opponents Sweden, but the USA defence had dangerwomen Nahomi Kawasumi and Kozue Ando well-marshalled for much of the half.\nThe surprise finalists did manage to breach the USA area once in the opening half, when fleet-of-foot Shinobu Ohno, playing in her second World Cup, slid the ball into the path of Ando who fell over as she struck what was a tame effort into the hands of goalkeeper Hope Solo.\nThe second half followed a similar pattern to the first, with USA the more threatening of the two sides.\nForward Morgan, who came on at half-time for Cheney, tried to make her mark within four minutes of setting foot on the pitch, when she stretched out a leg to poke a driven cross against the post.\nThe pacy 22-year-old had given the USA an alternative target to the physical and aerial threat of Wambach, and in the 69th minute she scored what, at that point, was the most important goal of her young career.\nMidfielder Megan Rapinoe, whose delivery was exemplary on the night, launched a 50-yard pass over the top which Morgan latched onto before driving into the box and launching an angled drive past the reach of Ayumi Kaihori.\nThe youngster was close to tears as she slid to the ground and was embraced by her team-mates.\nThe USA seemed comfortably on course to victory with Japan dormant as an attacking force.\nBut with nine minutes remaining the Asian side woke up when Rachel Buehler and Alex Krieger failed to clear their lines allowing Miyama to smash the loose ball past Solo.\nThe USA were the stronger team in extra time and regained the lead at the end of the first period when Wambach headed in her 13th goal in world cup finals after connecting with Morgan's cross from the left.\nBut once again, resilient and stubborn Japan equalised when captain Sawa produced an audacious flick from a corner that left keeper Solo helpless.\nUSA pressed again in search for a late winner. Morgan was en route to scoring her second before she was brought down by Azuza Iwashimizu on the edge of the area, who received a straight red from referee Bibiana Steinhaus.\nThe free-kick came to nothing which was followed by the whistle to signal the end of extra-time.\nA nervous-looking Shannon Boxx set the tone for USA's penalty kicks as she struck her effort straight at Kaihori. The Japanese keeper also saved from Tobin Heath while Carli Lloyd blazed over the bar. Wambach was the only player to find the back of the net but by this stage it was advantage Japan.\nNorio Sasaki's side missed one but scored the all-important penalty when young defender Kumagai stayed cool to fire in a brilliant spot-kick high into net. \n",

They can choose whether to share them publicly or limit the images to a specified group.\nThe duo behind the app hope that people will share at least some of their photos publicly.\n\"I envisage a day when historians and educational institutions can use it, for example, to chart a high street going back over decades,\" said Mr Newsome.\nAndrew Mitchell, a social media officer at Northumberland National Park, is using the app to chart changes in the history of the park\n\"We are celebrating our 60th anniversary and I read about the app and thought it would be a good fit. We had lots of people telling us that they had pictures but had no way of getting them to us. For us it is a way to see how the park has changed.\"\n\"We can do this on Instagram or other social media but there is a lot of digital detritus on there and this allows people to focus on something specific.\"\nA trial version of the Clixta app has been used by around 300 users and is now available to the wider public via Android's Google Play store and Apple's iTunes.\nOnce it has established its user base, the founders said they may introduce subscriptions. \n",

Twelve were found guilty of murder and one of wounding with intent and possessing a bladed article.\nAmong them were Tyler Burton and Nicholas Terrelonge, who were found guilty of murdering Ashley Latty in a group attack in Dagenham, east London, in May 2014.\nRejecting their appeal, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the Supreme Court judgement would \"not have made a difference\" to the jury's verdict in the trial and the convictions \"were and are safe\".\nAn appeal was also brought on behalf of Asher Johnson, his brother Lewis and Reece Garwood, who were given life sentences for the murder of Thomas Cudjoe in Ilford, east London, in November 2012.\nA fourth convicted man, Jerome Green, was seen in CCTV footage holding a knife and apparently stabbing Mr Cudjoe as he sat in the driver's seat of a car in a garage forecourt.\nLawyers argued there was no evidence of common enterprise between his clients and Green and the images did not show they had been involved in a planned attack.\nRejecting the appeal, Lord Thomas said the verdicts would have been \"no different\" following the Supreme Court ruling.\nHe said the court was \"satisfied that there was no injustice, let alone substantial injustice\".\nThe decision to reject their cases was met with cries of protest by supporters of the men sitting in the public gallery at the Court of Appeal.\nThe campaign group Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association (JENGBA) said families of those convicted under the law had been left in tears by the decision.\nGroup co-founder Jan Cunliffe said: \"Some of the families were very, very distraught and left the court room in tears.\n\"I'm feeling numb, but we're determined to carry on, we're not going to stop.\"\nShe said the group was taking advice about the possibility of challenging the judgement in the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court ruling applies to England, Wales, Northern Ireland and most UK overseas common law territories but not Scotland, which has its own rules on joint enterprise.\nAt the time, campaigners said the change would make the law fairer, but some murder victims' relatives said they were worried about possible appeals.\nJoint enterprise law was originally used to stop aristocrats from duelling, allowing all those involved in the duel, including doctors, to be charged with murder along with the duellists.\nThe law is regarded as a vital prosecuting tool and was used to convict David Norris and Gary Dobson in 2012 for the 1993 murder of Stephen Lawrence.\nHowever, in February the Supreme Court ruled that the courts \"took a wrong turn\" in 1984 in their interpretation of the law.\nThis judgement referred to a ruling in a case in which three gang members armed with knives burst into the home of a prostitute and her husband in Hong Kong, intending to collect a debt.\nThe husband was stabbed to death at the hand of at least one of the gang members and all three were convicted of murder.\nIn February judges said the error made had been \"to equate foresight with intent to assist, as a matter of law; the correct approach is to treat it as evidence of intent\". \n",

We want you back among the unity of nations.\"\nThe Qataris deny accusations that they support Islamist extremists.\nPresident Trump had previously tweeted support for the move to isolate Qatar over its alleged financing of extremist groups.\nHe repeated that message forcefully from the podium, despite US efforts to diffuse the crisis: he even claimed to have been part of the decision made by Saudi Arabia and others.\nIndeed, his tone and approach undercut that of Secretary Tillerson, who barely an hour earlier had delivered a more nuanced appeal for de-escalation, making clear he expected all parties to end the crisis.\nWhile Tillerson said Qatar must respond to its neighbours' concerns, he also urged the others to take action against extremists within their borders.\nUS officials insisted the two men were sending the same message with different emphases, aimed at encouraging their Arab allies to put aside grievances and focus on fighting terrorism.\nBut it was the differences that resonated: another example, it seemed, of Trump forging a path at variance with that of his top officials.\nNotably, while he criticized Qatar, he thanked Saudi Arabia. His embrace of Riyadh on a recent trip there seems to have influenced his thinking, and raised questions about the direction of any US mediation.\nOn Monday, the tiny, oil- and gas-rich state was cut off and isolated by some of the Arab world's most powerful countries.\nQatari planes were banned from using some of their neighbours' airspace.\nThe dramatic moves came after years of tension between Qatar and its Gulf neighbours, in particular Saudi Arabia.\nBahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE gave Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, and banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar.\n\"There are humanitarian consequences to this blockade,\" Mr Tillerson said in Washington. \"We are seeing shortages of food, families are being forcibly separated and children pulled out of school.\"\nEarlier on Friday, Mr Trump discussed Qatar and the need for Gulf unity with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.\nMr Tillerson said the ongoing row was having an effect on regional co-operation on countering extremism. Qatar is home to the biggest American airbase in the region, with about 10,000 troops.\nThe US secretary of state added that the blockade was \"impairing US and other international business activities in the region\" and that the US backed mediation efforts being pursued by Kuwait.\nHis statement came hours after German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for the \"sea and air blockades\" to be lifted.\nIn other new developments:\nSaudi Arabia has said Qatar needs to cut ties with the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, if it wanted to end its isolation.\nOn Thursday, Qatar's Sheikh Mohammed said his country had been isolated \"because we are successful and progressive\" and called his country \"a platform for peace not terrorism\".\nHe added: \"We are not ready to surrender, and will never be ready to surrender, the independence of our foreign policy.\" \n",

And certainly not at the cost of those that feel the rich \"play by a different set of rules\" - pointing out that trust in business among those on lower incomes languishes at 35%.\nBusiness leaders I spoke to after her speech know that Mrs May is not a fundamentalist when it comes to free markets. Yes, they work, but they need to be controlled.\nOne cabinet minister told me recently, that the PM was very comfortable with the \"interventionist\" tag.\nWe will hear more about that when Mrs May announces the government's industrial strategy next week.\nOne chief executive of a global resources business worth many billions of pounds said that there was an understanding that the PM had been dealt \"a pretty tough hand\".

About 20 are still detained.\nHow seriously do the Chinese take 'confession' videos?\nTwo other activists - Hu Shigen and Zhai Yanmin - were convicted in Tianjin this week under the same charge.

Their fate was sealed before they stepped into the courtroom,\" said Roseann Rife, East Asia Research Director at Amnesty International.\nMr Zhou pleaded guilty in court and will not appeal against the ruling, reported state media outlet Xinhua.\nProsecutors said he had worked \"to encourage lawyers to highlight sensitive cases and hired protesters to disturb the judicial system\".\nHe also \"played a major role in a group of activists who attempted to manipulate public opinion and damage national security by spreading subversive thoughts,\" state media quoted the verdict as saying.\nThe 52-year-old has also been deprived of his political rights for five years.\nZhou Shifeng has been involved in some of China's most sensitive cases, from taking on a powerful company involved in selling tainted baby milk formula to representing those persecuted for their religious or political beliefs.\nThe main thrust of the case against him seems to be that he encouraged protesters to gather in support of his defendants, a perhaps understandable strategy in a system in which 99.9% of cases end in a conviction.\nIn July last year, more than 300 human rights activists and lawyers were detained or questioned and Mr Zhou is one of the 20 or so who have remained in custody ever since.\nHis is the third such trial this week, and his sentence will serve the likely purpose to all this: sending a stern warning to those who dare to challenge the government in its own, Communist-Party-run courts.\nSome 40 people, including lawyers and journalists were present at the brief trial.\nBut none of his family members were in court, as he allegedly requested in a letter posted by the court on micro-blogging site Weibo.\nMr Zhou and the now-closed Fengrui law firm have frequently challenged the Chinese government.\nThey have represented clients such as activist artist Ai Weiwei and members of the banned Falun Gong meditation sect, as well as taking on the company behind the selling of tainted baby milk formula.\nOn Monday, prominent Fengrui lawyer Wang Yu was allegedly released on bail, after a video in which she renounced her legal work.\nShe also denounced Mr Zhou in the video, calling him an unqualified lawyer, and added that \"foreign forces\" were using the firm to undermine and discredit the government.\nChina's crackdown, which started last year, has targeted the country's small human rights advocacy movement and involved lawyers tackling cases to do with freedom of speech, religion or abuses of power. \n",

As it pushes up against the air, the temperatures on its leading surfaces will soar to 1,700C.\nFlaps and thrusters will be used to control the trajectory, ensuring the IXV comes down close to a recovery ship some 3,000km west of the Galapagos Islands.\nA parachute system deployed in the very late stages of the flight will put the two-tonne vehicle gently in the water. Floatation balloons will come out to stop it from sinking.\nBeginning to end, the complete mission is expected to last approximately one hour and 40 minutes.\nEurope's expertise on re-entry technologies is more limited than, say, the US's or Russia's - something it wants to change with the help of the IXV.\nEsa's project manager Giorgio Tumino told BBC News: \"Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit.  So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - this third leg we need to master as well as other spacefaring nations.\"\nEurope has produced one or two re-entry capsule systems in the past, but the IXV's complex \"lifting body\" is new territory.\nThe vehicle is packed with sensors. Their data will feed back into materials research and into the computer models used to describe the energetic physics that occurs when an object plunges through atmospheric gases at hypersonic speeds.\nThe IXV will start its data dump the moment it clears the descent's radio blackout phase, which occurs when the vehicle is enveloped by the hot plasma created during high-speed re-entry.\nGetting all the information off the craft while it is still in the air means the mission can complete its objectives even if something goes wrong at splashdown and the IXV sinks.\nEsa has already approved a follow-on project called Pride (Programme for Reusable In-orbit Demonstrator in Europe).\nThis would see the development of another re-entry vehicle but with a key difference - the ability to land on a runway.\nIn this respect, the Pride craft would look very similar to the X-37B mini shuttle, which is operated by the American military.\nNo-one is quite sure what missions are flown by this unmanned craft, but they are likely to include the early testing of new technologies for future satellites.\nThis could be a role also for Europe's Pride vehicle. In-orbit servicing of satellites is a capability often discussed in this context as well.\nEsa nations will meet shortly to define these roles.\n\"We need still to agree with all the member states all the different types of operations in orbit. But whatever the payload, it will always be in the perimeter space of civilian applications,\" stresses Mr Tumino.\nThe UK is not involved in the Italian-led IXV programme, but it is signed up to Pride, albeit at a low contribution.\nBritain's interests relate to reusable launcher technologies and to the safe return of planetary samples, such as rock specimens collected on Mars.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmosI \n",

He pledged to never use the word again.\n\"As we all know I can be a complete tool. Yesterday I was worse, I was an ignorant tool,\" he said.\n\"I honestly didn't know the negative and deeply hurtful impact that word has not only on members of the LGBTIQ community but on their family and friends.\n\"Because I know trans people are fun-loving, life-celebrating people I actually assumed they might laugh along with me, I assumed wrong.\"\nWhile the apology was praised on social media, comments on the Today show's Facebook page were mixed.\n\"Personally think there was no need to apologise,\" said one Facebook user. \"I think the minority that complain need to have a cup of cement and harden up.\"\nCorey Sinclair, editor of Sydney's Star Observer gay and lesbian community newspaper, said the apology was \"refreshing and heartfelt\".\n\"Karl seems to have taken on board what people have been saying and acknowledged the damage his comments caused,\" he said.\n\"I think it takes a big person to admit when they're wrong. Hopefully it has made others aware that sort of language is simply unacceptable.\"\nDespite his brash on-screen personality, Stefanovic has won plaudits for his sensitive side. He once wore the same suit on the Today show for a year to highlight the scrutiny his female co-hosts faced over their fashion choices. \n",
